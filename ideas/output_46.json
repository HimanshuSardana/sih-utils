  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system utilizes computer vision and machine learning (AI) for real-time waste identification. Sensors (IoT) detect waste type (plastic, paper, metal, organic) and weight. Robotic arms or automated sorting mechanisms then accurately segregate the waste into designated bins. Data from sensors and segregation processes are sent to a cloud platform for analysis and optimization. Technologies involved include: High-resolution cameras for image capture, Edge AI processors for on-device recognition, various sensors (proximity, weight, chemical) for material verification, actuators and motors for robotic arm movement, and a cloud-based analytics platform for data storage, processing, and system management. This integrated approach ensures efficient and precise segregation, preparing waste for further recycling processes.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Existing AI and IoT technologies are mature enough for accurate waste identification and automated sorting.",
    "Modular hardware components can be readily sourced and integrated, reducing development complexity and cost.",
    "Pilot projects demonstrate successful automated waste sorting, validating the core technological approach."
