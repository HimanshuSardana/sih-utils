  "need_to_know": "Smart Waste Segregation refers to the automated or intelligent separation of different types of waste materials (e.g., plastics, paper, organic). A Recycling System is the process of converting waste materials into new products, aiming to reduce consumption of fresh raw materials.",
  "problem_statement": "Inefficient manual waste segregation leads to high contamination rates, hindering effective recycling processes. This results in increased landfill waste, environmental pollution, and the unnecessary depletion of natural resources.",
  "idea": "An AI-powered Smart Waste Segregation and Recycling System that automates waste sorting at the source, optimizes collection logistics, and improves overall recycling efficiency for a sustainable future.",
  "problem_resolution": "Our system leverages AI and IoT to accurately sort waste, reducing contamination and increasing recycling rates. It streamlines collection, minimizing operational costs and environmental impact, fostering a cleaner planet.",
  "usps": [
    "High-accuracy AI-driven sorting at source reduces contamination significantly.",
    "Real-time data analytics provide insights for optimized waste collection routes and management.",
    "User-friendly interface encourages public participation and sustainable practices.",
    "Scalable and adaptable design suitable for diverse urban and residential environments.",
    "Reduces operational costs for municipalities through automation and efficiency gains."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system utilizes an intelligent waste bin equipped with IoT sensors (e.g., proximity, weight, chemical sensors) and an integrated camera. When waste is deposited, a computer vision model, trained with deep learning on various waste types, identifies the material. Robotic arms or mechanical sorting mechanisms then segregate the waste into designated compartments for different categories (e.g., plastics, paper, metal, organic). The data collected from these smart bins is sent to a cloud platform, where machine learning algorithms analyze fill levels and optimize collection routes for waste management vehicles. This entire process ensures accurate segregation at the point of disposal and efficient collection for recycling facilities. Technologies involved include IoT, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Robotics, Cloud Computing, and Data Analytics.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Existing sensor, AI, and robotics technologies are mature enough for integration.",
    "Modular design allows for phased implementation and ease of maintenance and upgrades.",
    "Pilot programs in controlled environments can demonstrate viability and gather crucial data.",
    "Strong public and governmental push for sustainable solutions creates a receptive market."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Growing global demand for efficient waste management and recycling solutions.",
    "Potential for revenue generation through sales of sorted recyclable materials.",
    "Significant cost savings for municipalities in waste collection and landfill expenses.",
    "Attracts investment due to its environmental benefits and economic efficiency."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Substantially reduces landfill waste, mitigating soil and water pollution.",
    "Promotes a robust circular economy by maximizing resource recovery and reuse."
