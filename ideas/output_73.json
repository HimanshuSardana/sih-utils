  "how_it_works": "Users record their sports performance exercises via a mobile application. The app then uploads these videos to a cloud-based server. AI and Machine Learning algorithms, specifically computer vision models (e.g., using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch for pose estimation, object tracking, and biomechanical analysis), process the video data. These algorithms analyze various sport-specific metrics such as speed, agility, technique, form, and reaction time. Deep learning models continuously refine their accuracy with more data. The processed data is then compiled into comprehensive performance reports, offering objective scores, strengths, weaknesses, and personalized feedback. Technologies involved include mobile app development (iOS/Android), cloud computing platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), computer vision libraries (OpenCV), and machine learning frameworks.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Smartphone camera technology is ubiquitous and advanced enough for high-quality video capture.",
    "Existing AI/ML frameworks for computer vision are readily available for integration and powerful.",
    "Cloud computing infrastructure provides scalable processing power for intensive video analysis."
