  "how_it_works": "The system comprises solar photovoltaic (PV) panels that convert sunlight into electricity. This electricity powers submersible or surface pumps to remove water from mine pits or tailings dams. An energy storage system, typically lithium-ion batteries, stores excess solar energy for continuous operation during non-sunlight hours or peak demand. A smart control unit monitors water levels, solar power generation, battery status, and pump operation, optimizing energy use and ensuring efficient dewatering. Technologies involved include high-efficiency solar panels, robust industrial-grade pumps, advanced battery energy storage systems (BESS), and IoT-enabled monitoring and control systems for remote management.",
