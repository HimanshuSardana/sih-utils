  "need_to_know": "LT lines refer to Low Tension electrical lines, typically used for local distribution to homes and businesses. A circuit breaker is an automatic electrical switch designed to protect an electrical circuit from damage caused by an overload or short circuit. It does not primarily detect physical line breaks.",
  "problem_statement": "Current circuit breakers primarily react to overcurrents or short circuits, not physical line breaks. There's a critical need for an alternative software-driven system to detect and isolate broken Low Tension (LT) lines, preventing hazards and power outages efficiently.",
  "idea": "Develop a smart grid monitoring system utilizing real-time data analytics and IoT sensors. This software will precisely detect physical breaks in Low Tension (LT) lines and automatically trigger their safe deactivation, enhancing public safety and grid reliability.",
  "problem_resolution": "Our idea proposes a real-time monitoring software that uses sensor data to identify physical line breaks. Upon detection, it autonomously sends commands to smart switches, immediately isolating the broken LT line. This prevents electrocution risks and minimizes outage impact.",
  "usps": [
    "Enhanced Public Safety: Proactive detection of broken lines minimizes electrocution risks for the public and utility workers.",
    "Reduced Outage Duration: Pinpoints fault location rapidly, allowing quicker restoration and minimizing downtime for consumers.",
    "Automated Response: Automatically deactivates broken lines without human intervention, improving response time significantly.",
    "Preventative Maintenance Data: Collects data on line health, enabling predictive maintenance and preventing future breaks.",
    "Cost-Effective Grid Management: Reduces operational costs associated with manual fault detection and extended outages."

  "how_it_works": "The system integrates various technologies. IoT sensors (e.g., current sensors, vibration sensors, thermal cameras) are deployed along LT lines to continuously monitor electrical parameters, physical integrity, and environmental factors. Data from these sensors is transmitted via a secure wireless network (e.g., LoRaWAN, 5G, NB-IoT) to a central cloud-based platform. This platform hosts a real-time data analytics engine, potentially leveraging Machine Learning algorithms, to analyze sensor data for anomalies indicative of a line break (e.g., sudden loss of current, unusual vibration patterns, localized temperature changes, or sag detection). Upon detecting a confirmed line break, the software triggers an automated command. This command is sent through the network to smart switches or remote terminal units (RTUs) integrated into the LT grid, instructing them to isolate the affected line section. This ensures immediate power cut-off to the broken segment, preventing hazards.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "IoT sensor technology for monitoring electrical parameters and physical integrity is already mature and widely available.",
    "Cloud computing and real-time data analytics platforms can process vast amounts of sensor data efficiently.",
    "Smart grid infrastructure with remote switching capabilities is increasingly being adopted by utilities."
