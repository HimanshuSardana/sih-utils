  "how_it_works": "The process begins in Fusion 360 by defining performance criteria, load conditions, and manufacturing constraints for the bicycle frame. We input desired weight reduction targets, stiffness requirements, and material properties like those of titanium alloys or high-performance composites.Generative Design is then employed, where Fusion's algorithms automatically explore thousands of design possibilities, presenting optimal geometries that meet the specified parameters. This automates the initial design exploration, leading to highly efficient and innovative structures.Following this, Topology Optimization is applied to further refine material distribution. This method removes unnecessary material from low-stress areas and reinforces high-stress regions, resulting in organic, often lattice-like internal structures that maximize strength while minimizing weight.Finally, the optimized 3D models are prepared for Additive Build. This involves generating support structures, orienting the part for optimal print quality, and slicing the model into layers. The frame is then manufactured using advanced 3D printing technologies such as Selective Laser Melting (SLM) for metal alloys or Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) for composite materials, allowing for complex geometries and internal structures not achievable with traditional fabrication methods.",
