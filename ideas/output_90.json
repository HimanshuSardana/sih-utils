  "need_to_know": "Fusion software (Fusion 360) is an integrated CAD/CAM/CAE platform for product design and manufacturing. Generative Design is an AI-driven method that explores numerous design solutions based on specified constraints. Topology Optimization is a structural optimization method that removes material from a design while maintaining its structural integrity. Additive Build refers to features within Fusion software that prepare a design for additive manufacturing. 3D printing is a manufacturing process that creates three-dimensional objects by adding material layer by layer from a digital design.",

  "how_it_works": "The process begins in Fusion 360 where the design space for the tennis racket handle is defined, along with load conditions, material properties, and manufacturing constraints. Generative Design is then employed to explore numerous design iterations, focusing on optimizing the internal lattice structures for vibration dampening and weight reduction, while ensuring ergonomic fit. Topology Optimization further refines the generated designs, selectively removing non-essential material to achieve an optimal strength-to-weight ratio. The 'Additive Build' features within Fusion 360 are then used to prepare the final, optimized 3D model for printing, including setting build orientation, generating support structures, and creating toolpaths. The handle is then fabricated using advanced 3D printing technologies such as Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) with durable, lightweight polymers like Nylon PA12, which can produce the complex geometries and lattice structures generated by the software, impossible to achieve with traditional manufacturing methods.",
