  "need_to_know": "Telemedicine is remote clinical healthcare provided via technology. Nabha refers to a city and its surrounding rural areas in Punjab, India, indicating a focus on rural health access.",
  "problem_statement": "Rural areas in Nabha face significant barriers to accessing specialist healthcare due to geographical distance and limited medical infrastructure. This leads to delayed diagnoses and treatment, compromising patient health outcomes.",
  "idea": "Establish a 'Rural Telehealth Hub Network' in Nabha. Connect existing rural primary health centers with urban specialist doctors using secure digital platforms, supported by trained local health workers.",
  "problem_resolution": "This network directly bridges the gap between rural patients and urban specialists. It ensures timely consultations, reduces patient travel burdens, and significantly improves overall health outcomes for remote communities.",
  "usps": [
    "Leverages existing local primary health center infrastructure, minimizing initial setup costs and maximizing resource utilization.",
    "Empowers local health workers through comprehensive training and digital tools, enhancing their roles in patient care coordination.",
    "Offers a highly cost-effective model, drastically reducing patient travel expenses and lost wages associated with urban visits.",
    "Designed for scalability, this model can be easily replicated and expanded to other underserved rural regions across Punjab.",
    "Provides access to a diverse range of medical specialists, offering comprehensive care that is otherwise unavailable locally."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system involves setting up dedicated telemedicine booths in rural primary health centers. These booths are equipped with computers, internet connectivity (using existing broadband/4G/5G infrastructure), and essential diagnostic tools. Local health workers, trained in basic patient assessment and digital operation, assist patients. Patient data, including medical history and vitals, is securely uploaded to an Electronic Health Records (EHR) system. Specialists in urban centers access this data and conduct virtual consultations via secure video conferencing platforms (e.g., custom secure platform, or commercial solutions like Zoom/Google Meet with enhanced security). Prescriptions and follow-up plans are digitally communicated back to the patient and local health center. Cloud storage ensures data accessibility and security.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Leveraging existing digital infrastructure and readily available internet connectivity in most rural areas.",
    "Training local ASHA workers and nurses for basic telemedicine assistance is a feasible and quick process.",
    "Many open-source telehealth platforms exist, reducing software development costs and accelerating deployment."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Potential for significant government funding and grants due to alignment with national digital health missions.",
    "Reduces the burden on overcrowded urban hospitals by decentralizing primary and specialist care effectively.",
    "Sustainable through a mixed revenue model involving public funding and potential micro-payments for specialist consults."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Enhances health equity by providing underserved rural populations with critical access to specialist medical care.",
    "Significantly improves public health outcomes through earlier disease detection and more consistent treatment adherence."
  ],
  "beneficiaries": [
    "Rural residents of Nabha, gaining convenient and affordable access to specialist healthcare previously out of reach.",
    "Urban specialist doctors, expanding their reach and impact while managing patient load more efficiently."
