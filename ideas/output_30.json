  "need_to_know": "AI (Artificial Intelligence) refers to systems that can learn and make decisions. In farming, this means using data to predict optimal conditions, helping farmers make informed choices.",
  "problem_statement": "Farmers often struggle with choosing the right crops due to varying soil conditions, weather patterns, and market demands. This leads to reduced yields, financial losses, and unsustainable farming practices.",
  "idea": "An AI-powered crop recommendation system that provides data-driven suggestions to farmers. It analyzes various factors to ensure optimal crop selection, maximizing yield and profitability for sustainable agriculture.",
  "problem_resolution": "This AI system analyzes environmental, soil, and market data to recommend the best crops for specific land, reducing uncertainty. It optimizes resource use and improves farmer livelihoods.",
  "usps": [
    "Personalized crop suggestions based on unique farm data.",
    "Predictive analytics for future market trends and weather.",
    "Optimizes resource allocation, reducing water and fertilizer waste.",
    "Integrates with existing farm management tools easily.",
    "Empowers farmers with data for better decision-making."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system collects data from various sources including soil sensors (pH, nutrients, moisture), local weather stations (temperature, rainfall, humidity), historical yield data, and current market prices for different crops. This data is fed into a machine learning model, specifically using algorithms like regression (for yield prediction), classification (for crop suitability), and time-series analysis (for market trends). Technologies involved include IoT devices for data collection, cloud computing for storage and processing, and advanced machine learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) for model training and inference. The user interface, accessible via web or mobile app, presents clear, actionable recommendations to farmers, including optimal planting times, irrigation schedules, and potential harvest yields.",
