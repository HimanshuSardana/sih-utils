  "need_to_know": "Higher Education refers to post-secondary institutions like universities and colleges. A Digital Mental Health and Psychological Support System uses online platforms and technology to provide mental health services and support.",
  "problem_statement": "Students in higher education face significant mental health challenges due to academic pressure, social adjustments, and life transitions. Existing support systems are often insufficient, inaccessible, or stigmatized, leading to unaddressed issues affecting well-being and academic performance.",
  "idea": "A comprehensive digital platform offering accessible, confidential, and personalized mental health and psychological support tailored specifically for university students. It integrates various self-help tools, peer support, and professional counseling services.",
  "problem_resolution": "This platform provides 24/7 access to mental health resources, professional counseling, and peer support. It overcomes barriers of stigma, limited availability, and geographic constraints often found in traditional university mental health services.",

  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system, named 'MindCampus', works by providing a multi-faceted approach to mental wellness. Upon registration, students complete an initial assessment, which uses AI/ML (e.g., natural language processing for sentiment analysis, predictive modeling) to understand their specific needs and risks. Based on this, MindCampus generates a personalized dashboard. Students can access self-help modules (e.g., CBT-based exercises, mindfulness, journaling) or connect with licensed therapists via secure video calls (using Twilio API for real-time communication). An anonymous, moderated peer support forum allows students to share experiences. Emergency contacts and crisis lines are prominently featured for immediate help. The platform uses a mobile app (built with React Native/Flutter) and a web portal (React/Angular) for accessibility. The backend (Node.js/Python with Django/Flask) handles user authentication, data management (PostgreSQL/MongoDB), and API integrations. AI/ML models (TensorFlow/PyTorch, scikit-learn) are deployed on cloud platforms like AWS/Azure/GCP for scalability and efficient processing of assessment data and content recommendations. Strong encryption (SSL/TLS) and adherence to data privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) are fundamental to the system's architecture.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Existing cloud infrastructure and advanced AI/ML tools allow for rapid, scalable development and deployment.",
    "A large pool of skilled developers and mental health professionals can collaborate on content and support.",
    "The tech-savvy student demographic ensures high adoption rates and ease of platform integration into their routines."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
