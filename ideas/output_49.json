  "need_to_know": "An \"AI-Driven Public Health Chatbot\" is an Artificial Intelligence-powered conversational agent providing health information. \"Disease Awareness\" refers to educating the public about symptoms, prevention, and management of various health conditions.",
  "problem_statement": "Lack of accessible, reliable, and personalized public health information hinders disease awareness. This leads to delayed action, increased misinformation, and poorer health outcomes for communities.",
  "idea": "Develop an AI-driven public health chatbot to provide instant, accurate, and personalized information on diseases, prevention, and local health advisories, enhancing public health literacy.",
  "problem_resolution": "The chatbot resolves information gaps by offering real-time, evidence-based health guidance. It boosts disease awareness, counters misinformation, and empowers users to make informed health decisions.",
  "usps": [
    "Personalized health information based on user queries and location data.",
    "24/7 accessibility through various platforms, ensuring constant support.",
    "Real-time updates on public health alerts and local disease outbreaks.",
    "Multilingual support to cater to diverse linguistic communities.",
    "Provides actionable insights for public health campaign optimization."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The AI-driven chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand user queries. A machine learning model, trained on extensive public health datasets (e.g., WHO, CDC guidelines, medical journals), generates accurate and contextual responses. It integrates with public health APIs to pull real-time data on disease prevalence, local health advisories, and treatment options. Key technologies include Python for backend logic, NLP libraries (like SpaCy, NLTK), machine learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) for model training and inference, and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) for scalable deployment and database management. The chatbot maintains a knowledge base of verified health information, continuously updated and refined.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Leverages mature NLP and AI technologies for robust conversational capabilities.",
    "Abundant, verifiable public health data and guidelines are available for training.",
    "Cloud computing infrastructure allows scalable, cost-effective deployment."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "High public demand for reliable health information, especially during crises.",
    "Reduces burden on healthcare systems by answering common health queries.",
    "Scalable to serve a large global user base with minimal operational cost."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Significantly improves public health literacy and promotes preventive behaviors.",
    "Reduces the spread of misinformation, leading to better community health outcomes."
