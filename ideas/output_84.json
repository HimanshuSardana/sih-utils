  "need_to_know": "Non-Revenue Water (NRW) is water that has been produced and is lost before it reaches the customer. Losses can be real losses (leakage) or apparent losses (unauthorized consumption, metering inaccuracies).",
  "problem_statement": "Communities face significant water loss due to leaks and theft (Non-Revenue Loss), coupled with low awareness of conservation. Additionally, there's a critical need for efficient wastewater treatment and safe reuse for domestic purposes to ensure sustainable water management.",
  "idea": "A smart, integrated water management system utilizing IoT sensors, AI analytics, and advanced purification. It detects leaks, promotes conservation via real-time data, and treats wastewater for safe domestic reuse, creating a circular water economy.",
  "problem_resolution": "Our solution addresses non-revenue loss by pinpointing leaks, boosts conservation through user engagement, and solves the domestic water shortage by treating and safely reusing wastewater, ensuring a sustainable and efficient water cycle.",
  "usps": [
    "Real-time leak detection and predictive maintenance minimize non-revenue water loss significantly.",
    "Gamified user interface educates and incentivizes households for active water conservation.",
    "Advanced multi-stage filtration ensures treated wastewater meets stringent domestic reuse standards.",
    "Integrated platform provides holistic view of water infrastructure, enhancing operational efficiency.",
    "Reduces reliance on fresh water sources, fostering a self-sustaining urban water ecosystem."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system comprises several integrated components. IoT sensors (pressure, flow, acoustic sensors) are deployed across the water distribution network to monitor water flow, pressure, and detect anomalies indicative of leaks in real-time. These sensors transmit data via LoRaWAN or cellular networks to a central cloud platform. An AI/Machine Learning model analyzes this data to identify leak locations, predict potential pipe bursts, and detect unauthorized consumption patterns. For water conservation, smart meters track household consumption, and a mobile application provides users with real-time usage data, personalized tips, and gamified challenges to encourage efficient water use. For wastewater treatment, a decentralized or centralized plant employs a multi-stage process: preliminary screening, primary sedimentation, activated sludge (biological treatment), ultrafiltration/reverse osmosis, and UV disinfection. Treated water is then safely distributed for non-potable domestic uses like flushing toilets, irrigation, and laundry, with strict quality monitoring using additional sensors and lab tests.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "IoT sensor technology for monitoring is mature and cost-effective for wide-scale deployment.",
    "AI/ML algorithms for anomaly detection are well-established and adaptable to water network data.",
    "Modular wastewater treatment technologies exist and can be scaled for urban or decentralized needs."

  "viability_points": [
    "Reduces operational costs for utilities by minimizing water loss and infrastructure damage.",
    "Creates new revenue streams from treated wastewater, improving water resource security.",
    "Attracts public and private investment due to strong environmental and economic benefits."

  "impact_points": [
    "Significantly reduces water scarcity by preserving existing resources and creating new ones.",
    "Improves public health through access to safely managed and reused water resources."
