  "need_to_know": "Non-Revenue Water (NRW) refers to water that has been produced and is lost before it reaches the customer, primarily due to leakages, theft, and metering inaccuracies. It represents a significant financial and resource loss for water utilities.",
  "problem_statement": "Water utilities face substantial Non-Revenue Water losses. There's also a critical need to enhance public awareness for water conservation and implement advanced wastewater treatment for safe domestic reuse.",
  "idea": "A Smart Water Management Platform integrating IoT sensors for leak detection and consumption monitoring, coupled with AI-driven analytics, and an interactive public awareness module for conservation and wastewater reuse education.",
  "problem_resolution": "This platform addresses NRW by pinpointing leaks and theft, boosts conservation via real-time data and education, and promotes domestic reuse through informative content and verified treatment processes.",
  "usps": [
    "Real-time, granular leak detection minimizes water loss and infrastructure damage, significantly reducing Non-Revenue Water.",
    "Personalized water consumption insights empower users to actively conserve, fostering a culture of responsible water use.",
    "Integrated public awareness campaigns use gamification and data to educate on conservation and safe water reuse practices.",
    "AI-powered predictive analytics optimize water distribution and treatment processes, enhancing operational efficiency.",
    "Facilitates the adoption of treated wastewater for non-potable domestic use, extending water resources sustainably."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system uses a network of IoT sensors (flow meters, pressure sensors, acoustic sensors) deployed throughout the water distribution network to collect real-time data on water flow, pressure, and potential leak signatures. This data is transmitted to a central cloud platform. AI and machine learning algorithms analyze this data to detect anomalies indicating leaks, pipe bursts, or unauthorized consumption (theft) with high precision. For water conservation awareness, an integrated mobile application provides users with personalized consumption data, tips, and gamified challenges. It also features educational modules on wastewater treatment processes, benefits of reuse, and local regulations. Advanced wastewater treatment facilities will integrate their operational data, and the platform can provide verified information on the quality and safe applications of treated water for domestic purposes (e.g., toilet flushing, gardening), potentially connecting users with local reuse programs. Technologies involved include IoT devices, cloud computing (e.g., AWS, Azure), AI/ML for data analytics, mobile application development frameworks (e.g., React Native, Flutter), and secure data transmission protocols.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "IoT sensor technology is mature and cost-effective, allowing for widespread deployment in existing infrastructure.",
    "Cloud computing and AI analytics platforms are readily available, enabling robust data processing and insights.",
    "Mobile application development is a well-established field, making the awareness module easily deployable to users."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Reduces operational costs for utilities by minimizing water loss and optimizing maintenance efforts, ensuring financial savings.",
    "Enhances community trust and engagement by providing transparency and empowering citizens in water management.",
    "Creates new revenue streams by potentially selling treated wastewater or through efficiency-driven utility savings."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Significantly reduces water wastage, improving resource availability for communities and environmental sustainability.",
    "Fosters a proactive, informed citizenry that actively participates in water conservation and resource management efforts."
  ],
  "beneficiaries": [
    "Water Utility Companies: Benefit from reduced NRW, optimized operations, and improved public relations and compliance.",
    "Residential Consumers: Gain awareness, save on water bills, and potentially access new sources of recycled water for non-potable needs."
