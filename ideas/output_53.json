  "need_to_know": "Onion shelf life refers to the period onions remain suitable for consumption or sale after harvest, before spoilage. Extending this reduces post-harvest losses and waste.",
  "problem_statement": "Current onion storage methods often lead to significant post-harvest losses due to spoilage, sprouting, and rotting. This impacts farmers' income, market supply, and consumer prices, creating food waste.",
  "idea": "Our idea is an IoT-enabled 'Smart Onion Storage System' that maintains optimal environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, ventilation) and provides real-time monitoring and predictive analytics to significantly extend onion shelf life.",
  "problem_resolution": "This system actively controls storage parameters to minimize spoilage factors like moisture, heat, and pathogens. Real-time data and alerts help intervene proactively, drastically reducing post-harvest losses for onions.",
  "usps": [
    "Precision environmental control using IoT sensors ensures ideal conditions for onion preservation, minimizing decay and sprouting effectively.",
    "AI-driven predictive analytics identify potential spoilage risks early, enabling timely intervention and preventing widespread losses.",
    "Remote monitoring and control via a user-friendly dashboard allow farmers to manage their storage from anywhere, anytime.",
    "Modular and scalable design makes the system adaptable for various storage capacities, from small farms to large warehouses.",
    "Significant reduction in post-harvest waste translates to higher profits for farmers and more stable market prices for consumers."

  "how_it_works": "The Smart Onion Storage System integrates a network of IoT sensors, microcontrollers, and cloud-based analytics. Temperature and humidity sensors continuously monitor the ambient conditions within the storage unit. Gas sensors detect early signs of ethylene or other spoilage gases. Data from these sensors is transmitted via Wi-Fi or cellular networks to a central cloud platform. An AI algorithm processes this real-time data to identify deviations from optimal conditions and predict potential spoilage events. Actuators, such as smart ventilation fans, automated cooling/heating units, and dehumidifiers, are then triggered by the microcontroller to adjust the environment. For example, if humidity rises, dehumidifiers activate; if temperature exceeds a threshold, cooling units or fans increase airflow. Farmers receive alerts and can view detailed reports through a mobile app or web dashboard, allowing remote control and insights into their onion stock's health. Technologies involved include: IoT sensors (temperature, humidity, gas), microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi), cloud computing platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure) for data storage and processing, AI/Machine Learning for predictive analytics, and mobile/web development for user interfaces.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Existing IoT sensor technology is mature and affordable, making hardware implementation straightforward and cost-effective.",
    "Cloud computing and AI platforms offer robust infrastructure for data processing and predictive analytics, readily available for integration.",
    "The system can be designed to integrate with existing storage structures, reducing initial setup costs and implementation complexity."
