  "how_it_works": "The system integrates a high-resolution camera with an embedded processing unit. Microscopic images are captured automatically. These images are then fed into a pre-trained Artificial Intelligence (AI) model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image recognition, running on the embedded system (e.g., using a Raspberry Pi or NVIDIA Jetson with optimized inference engines). The AI identifies the species of marine organisms and counts their numbers. Results are then stored locally and can be transmitted wirelessly (e.g., via Wi-Fi, cellular, or satellite link) to a cloud platform for further analysis, visualization, and long-term data storage. The core technologies involved are: embedded hardware, optical microscopy, high-resolution cameras, computer vision (CNNs), machine learning, edge computing for on-device inference, and robust data communication modules.",
