  "how_it_works": "The system integrates a high-resolution microscope with an embedded camera and a compact processing unit. A sample of marine water is placed under the microscope. The embedded camera captures live video or still images of the microscopic organisms. These images are fed to a pre-trained Artificial Intelligence (AI) model, specifically utilizing Computer Vision techniques (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks - CNNs) running on the embedded processor. The AI model identifies and classifies different species of marine organisms and counts their numbers. Results are displayed on a local screen or transmitted wirelessly (e.g., via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) to a connected device for further analysis and data logging. Technologies involved include embedded systems (e.g., Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson), high-resolution cameras, microscopy optics, machine learning (specifically Deep Learning for Computer Vision), image processing libraries (e.g., OpenCV), and potential cloud connectivity for data storage and advanced analytics.",
