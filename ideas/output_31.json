  "need_to_know": "Crowdsourced refers to obtaining input from a large group of people. Civic issues are problems affecting public welfare, like potholes, waste, or broken streetlights, within a community.",
  "problem_statement": "Currently, reporting civic issues is often slow and inefficient, leading to delayed resolutions and citizen frustration. Lack of a centralized, transparent system hinders effective municipal response.",
  "idea": "Our idea is a 'CivicConnect' platform: a crowdsourced mobile and web application for seamless reporting, tracking, and resolution of local civic issues, fostering community engagement.",
  "problem_resolution": "This platform offers a centralized, real-time mechanism for citizens to report issues, improving communication and accountability between residents and local authorities for faster problem-solving.",
  "usps": [
    "Real-time Issue Reporting: Instantly report problems with photos and location data via mobile.",
    "Community-Driven Prioritization: Users can upvote issues, helping authorities identify critical concerns.",
    "Transparent Resolution Tracking: Monitor issue status from report to resolution, enhancing trust.",
    "Gamified Citizen Engagement: Incentivizes active participation with points, badges, and leaderboards.",
    "Direct Authority Communication: Enables direct messaging with relevant municipal departments."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "Citizens use a mobile app (iOS/Android) or web portal to report issues, including descriptions, photos, and GPS coordinates. This data is stored in a cloud database (e.g., AWS, Azure). A Geographic Information System (GIS) maps issues visually. Backend APIs (e.g., Node.js, Python) process reports, categorize them using AI/ML for automatic routing to relevant city departments. Authorities access a dashboard to view, assign, and update issue statuses. Notifications (push, email) keep users informed. Technologies involved: Mobile Development (React Native, Flutter), Cloud Computing (AWS/Azure/GCP), GIS (OpenStreetMap, Mapbox API), Database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB), Backend Frameworks (Django/Flask/Node.js Express), AI/ML for classification, and Notification Services.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Leverages existing smartphone penetration and GPS capabilities for easy reporting.",
    "Utilizes mature cloud infrastructure and open-source GIS technologies, reducing development costs.",
    "Public willingness to contribute data for community improvement is already proven."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Reduces operational costs for municipalities by streamlining issue identification and management.",
    "Increases citizen satisfaction and trust in local government through transparency and responsiveness.",
    "Generates valuable data for urban planning and resource allocation for cities."

  "impact_points": [
    "Creates cleaner, safer, and more efficient urban environments, enhancing quality of life.",
    "Empowers citizens, fostering active participation and a stronger sense of community ownership."

  "beneficiaries": [
    "Citizens: Experience improved living conditions and a direct channel for their concerns.",
    "Local Government: Gains an efficient tool for issue management, data insights, and public trust."
