  "need_to_know": "MCB stands for Miniature Circuit Breaker, a safety device that automatically switches off an electrical circuit during an overload or short circuit. IEC 60898-1:2015 is an international standard defining the requirements for circuit-breakers used in household and similar installations, particularly for AC operation. A high-current short-circuit test is a critical procedure to verify that an MCB can safely interrupt a large fault current without damage.",
  "problem_statement": "Manual testing of MCBs for high-current short-circuit compliance with IEC 60898-1:2015 is inefficient, hazardous, and prone to human error. Manufacturers need a reliable, automated solution to ensure product safety and regulatory adherence.",

  "how_it_works": "The system involves a high-current source, a robust test fixture for the MCB, and an array of sensors for precise data acquisition. A programmable logic controller (PLC) or microcontroller acts as the central control unit, managing the test sequence and safety interlocks. The MCB is placed in the fixture, and test parameters compliant with IEC 60898-1:2015 are loaded via a Human-Machine Interface (HMI). The control unit then initiates the high-current short-circuit. Sensors (current transformers, voltage dividers) monitor the current, voltage, and the MCB's tripping time and performance. Data is captured by a high-speed data acquisition (DAQ) system. The control unit analyzes this real-time data against the standard's criteria to determine a pass or fail. The system automatically generates a detailed test report. Technologies involved include industrial PLCs (e.g., Siemens, Rockwell), high-power switching components (SCRs, contactors), precision current/voltage sensors, SCADA/HMI software for user interaction and data visualization, and DAQ modules. Software (e.g., Python, C++) can be used for custom control logic and data processing.",
