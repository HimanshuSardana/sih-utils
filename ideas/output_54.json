  "need_to_know": "MCB stands for Miniature Circuit Breaker, an automatic electrical switch protecting circuits from overload or short circuits. IEC 60898-1:2015 is an international standard defining performance requirements for MCBs used in households.",
  "problem_statement": "The existing process for high-current short-circuit testing of MCBs to comply with IEC 60898-1:2015 is often manual, time-consuming, and presents safety risks. This bottleneck impacts certification and production efficiency.",
  "idea": "Develop an automated, high-current short-circuit test system for Miniature Circuit Breakers (MCBs). This system will efficiently and safely verify MCB compliance with the stringent requirements of the IEC 60898-1:2015 standard.",
  "problem_resolution": "The automated system eliminates manual testing, drastically improving safety for operators. It accelerates test cycles, ensures consistent compliance, and provides precise data, thereby streamlining the certification process for MCB manufacturers.",
  "usps": [
    "Enhanced operator safety by removing manual intervention during high-current short-circuit tests, minimizing hazard exposure.",
    "Significantly faster testing cycles, reducing time-to-market for new MCB products and increasing production throughput.",

  ],
  "how_it_works": "The automated system integrates a high-current source, a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), various sensors, and custom software. An MCB is automatically loaded into a test fixture. The PLC, guided by the control software, activates the high-current source to apply a precise short-circuit current as per IEC 60898-1:2015. Sensors (current, voltage, temperature, trip status) continuously monitor the MCB's performance and environment. The data acquisition system captures all parameters in real-time. The control software analyzes the collected data against standard requirements to determine compliance. Safety interlocks controlled by the PLC ensure operator protection. Technologies involved include high-power switching components, precision current and voltage transducers, industrial PLCs (e.g., Siemens, Allen-Bradley), human-machine interfaces (HMI) for control, and a data logging and reporting module potentially developed using Python or LabVIEW. Robotic elements could handle MCB loading and unloading for full automation. The system validates the MCB's ability to safely interrupt high fault currents and withstand subsequent thermal and mechanical stresses.",
