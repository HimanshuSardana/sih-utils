  "need_to_know": "Real-time public transport tracking shows live locations and estimated arrival times. Small cities often lack this, leading to commuter uncertainty and inconvenience.",
  "problem_statement": "Small cities often lack real-time public transport tracking, causing uncertainty for commuters regarding bus locations and arrival times. This leads to long waits, missed connections, and reduced public transport usage.",
  "idea": "Develop an affordable, user-friendly real-time public transport tracking system specifically designed for small cities. It will provide live vehicle locations and accurate arrival predictions via a mobile app.",
  "problem_resolution": "This system solves uncertainty by providing live updates on bus locations and arrival times, helping commuters plan trips better, reduce wait times, and make public transport a more reliable option.",
  "usps": [
    "Cost-effective implementation tailored for smaller municipal budgets.",
    "Simple, intuitive mobile app interface for easy public access and adoption.",
    "Scalable architecture designed to grow seamlessly with city expansion and needs.",
    "Leverages open-source technologies, promoting community involvement and lower costs.",
    "Provides local data integration for accurate, context-specific information relevant to small cities."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system involves GPS trackers installed on public transport vehicles. These devices transmit real-time location data to a central cloud server (e.g., AWS, Azure) via cellular networks. A backend API processes this data, calculating estimated arrival times using algorithms that factor in traffic and routes. A user-friendly mobile application (iOS/Android) fetches this processed data via the API, displaying vehicle locations on a map and predicted arrival times at stops. Technologies: GPS modules, cellular IoT, cloud computing (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions), RESTful APIs, mobile development frameworks (e.g., React Native, Flutter), mapping services (e.g., OpenStreetMap, Google Maps API).",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "GPS technology and mobile network connectivity are readily available and affordable for deployment.",
    "Cloud computing platforms offer scalable infrastructure at manageable costs for initial setup.",
    "Open-source mapping and development tools reduce initial investment and accelerate the development cycle."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Improves commuter satisfaction, encouraging higher public transport ridership and local economic activity.",
    "Attracts potential government grants and aligns with smart city initiatives for funding.",
    "Offers data-driven insights for transport operators to optimize routes and schedules, reducing operational costs."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Enhances urban mobility, making public transport more efficient, reliable, and attractive for small city residents.",
    "Contributes to environmental sustainability by reducing private vehicle usage and traffic congestion."
  ],
  "beneficiaries": [
    "Daily commuters will experience reduced wait times, predictable travel, and improved journey planning.",
    "Public transport operators gain valuable insights for better fleet management and service optimization."
