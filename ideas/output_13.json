  "need_to_know": "Real-time public transport tracking means knowing the exact current location and estimated arrival times of public vehicles (like buses) at any given moment, accessible via digital platforms such as mobile apps or websites.",
  "problem_statement": "Small cities often lack real-time public transport tracking systems. This leads to commuter uncertainty about bus locations and schedules, resulting in wasted time, frustration, and reduced adoption of public transportation services.",
  "idea": "Develop a user-friendly, low-cost real-time public transport tracking system tailored for small cities. It will provide commuters with live bus locations and estimated arrival times via a simple mobile application and web portal, enhancing their daily commute.",
  "problem_resolution": "Our idea directly addresses the information gap by providing accurate, real-time data to commuters. This enhances convenience, significantly reduces waiting times, and ultimately encourages greater utilization and reliability of public transport in smaller urban areas.",
  "usps": [
    "Low-cost implementation and maintenance, optimized for small city budgets.",
    "Intuitive and easy-to-use interface accessible for all age groups.",
    "Scalable design to integrate new routes and vehicles seamlessly.",
    "Offline access to schedules and route maps for areas with limited connectivity.",
    "Data insights for city planners to optimize routes and schedules."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "GPS devices are installed on public transport vehicles, continuously transmitting their location data via cellular networks (e.g., 4G, NB-IoT) to a central cloud-based server. A backend application processes this real-time data, calculates estimated arrival times based on current traffic and predefined routes. This information is then made available through APIs. A user-friendly mobile application (iOS/Android, developed with frameworks like React Native or Flutter) and a web portal consume these APIs to display live vehicle locations on an interactive map (using GIS mapping services like OpenStreetMap or Google Maps API) and provide arrival predictions to commuters. Cloud computing platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure) host the backend and database, ensuring scalability and reliability.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "GPS tracking technology is mature, widely available, and cost-effective to deploy.",
    "Existing cellular network infrastructure in most small cities supports data transmission.",
    "Utilizing open-source mapping and software tools significantly reduces development costs."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Strong potential for partnerships with local city governments for funding and implementation.",
    "Subscription models for transport operators or localized advertising revenue streams.",
    "Improves city infrastructure, making the area more attractive to residents and businesses."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Significantly enhances commuter experience by reducing uncertainty and waiting times.",
    "Promotes environmental sustainability by encouraging greater public transport usage."
  ],
  "beneficiaries": [
    "Daily commuters benefit from predictable travel and reduced stress.",
    "Local city governments gain data for improved urban planning and service efficiency."
