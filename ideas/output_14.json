  "need_to_know": "Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) are local governing bodies in urban areas responsible for municipal services. Waste segregation is the separation of waste into different categories (e.g., wet, dry, hazardous) to facilitate recycling and proper disposal.",
  "problem_statement": "Urban Local Bodies struggle with effective monitoring of waste segregation at source and collection points. This leads to inefficient waste management, increased landfill burden, and environmental pollution, impacting public health and resource recovery.",
  "idea": "An AI-powered Waste Segregation Monitoring System that automates the identification and reporting of improperly segregated waste. This enhances compliance, improves collection efficiency, and promotes sustainable waste management practices across urban areas.",
  "problem_resolution": "This system uses real-time monitoring and AI analytics to identify non-segregated waste. It provides actionable insights to ULBs, enabling timely interventions and improving waste collection efficiency, ultimately reducing environmental impact.",
  "usps": [
    "Real-time monitoring and instant alerts for non-compliance.",
    "AI-driven accuracy in waste type identification and segregation assessment.",
    "Automated reporting and data analytics for informed decision-making.",
    "Reduced manual effort and operational costs for ULBs.",
    "Increased public accountability and improved waste management outcomes."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system utilizes IoT sensors, high-resolution cameras, and AI/ML algorithms. Cameras capture images of waste at collection points. These images are processed by AI models (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks for object detection and classification) in real-time to identify different waste types and detect improper segregation. IoT sensors (e.g., ultrasonic sensors for bin fill levels) can complement data. The processed data is sent to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure) for storage and further analysis. A web/mobile application dashboard provides ULB officials with real-time alerts, segregation reports, and performance metrics. This allows for immediate action and data-driven policy adjustments.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Leverages mature and readily available IoT sensor and camera technology.",
    "AI/ML models for object detection are well-developed and cost-effective.",
    "Cloud infrastructure provides scalable and robust data processing."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Aligns with national waste management policies and mandates.",
    "Offers significant cost savings by optimizing waste collection routes.",
    "Scalable to cover entire cities, integrating with existing infrastructure."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Significantly reduces landfill burden and environmental pollution.",
    "Promotes a cleaner, healthier urban environment for residents."
  ],
  "beneficiaries": [
    "Urban Local Bodies gain efficiency and compliance in waste management.",
    "Citizens benefit from improved public health and cleaner surroundings."
