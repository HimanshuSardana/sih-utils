  "need_to_know": "RE refers to Renewable Energy. Hosting capacity is the maximum amount of RE a feeder can integrate without issues. Distribution Feeders are parts of the grid delivering power. Power quality is the consistency of voltage, frequency, and waveform. High RE injection means large amounts of renewable energy being fed into the grid.",
  "problem_statement": "Integrating higher amounts of Renewable Energy (RE) into distribution feeders often degrades power quality. The challenge is to increase RE hosting capacity while maintaining grid stability and power quality, especially during peak RE generation periods.",
  "idea": "Develop an AI-powered Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS) coupled with smart inverters and localized energy storage. This system will optimize RE injection, manage voltage fluctuations, and enhance overall power quality within distribution networks.",
  "problem_resolution": "Our AI-powered DERMS dynamically manages RE injection, smart inverters, and storage to absorb excess energy and mitigate voltage swings. This approach increases hosting capacity while actively improving power quality and grid stability in real-time.",

    "Reduces electricity costs for consumers through optimized energy management and higher renewable penetration.",
    "Scalable and modular design allows for flexible deployment across various distribution network sizes and configurations."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system uses a combination of technologies. Smart meters and sensors across the distribution feeder collect real-time data on power flow, voltage, and RE generation. This data feeds into a central AI/Machine Learning engine which predicts RE output and load demand. Based on these predictions and current grid conditions, the AI sends commands to smart inverters connected to RE sources and local battery energy storage systems (BESS). Smart inverters can actively manage reactive power and voltage support, while BESS units store excess RE or inject power to stabilize the grid during dips. Communication between components is facilitated by a robust, secure IoT network. The AI continuously learns and adapts to optimize RE injection, minimize power quality issues like voltage sags/swells, and maximize the feeder's renewable energy hosting capacity.",
