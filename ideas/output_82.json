  "need_to_know": "A Digital Health Record Management System is an electronic system for storing and managing patient health information. Migrant workers in Kerala are a significant population group, often lacking consistent healthcare access due to mobility and language barriers. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are global goals set by the UN, including SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), which this system aims to support.",
  "problem_statement": "Migrant workers in Kerala face challenges in managing their health records, leading to fragmented care and poor health outcomes. A unified digital system is needed to ensure continuity of care and align with sustainable development goals.",
  "idea": "Develop 'Arogya Setu Kerala', a mobile-first Digital Health Record Management System tailored for migrant workers. It will provide secure, portable health records, facilitating seamless healthcare access and promoting well-being across geographical boundaries.",
  "problem_resolution": "Arogya Setu Kerala digitizes health records, making them accessible anytime, anywhere. This ensures continuity of care for migrant workers, irrespective of location, reducing health disparities and directly supporting key Sustainable Development Goals related to health and inequality.",
  "usps": [
    "Personalized, portable health records accessible via mobile, empowering workers to own their health data.",
    "Multilingual interface supporting various Indian languages, breaking down communication barriers in healthcare.",
    "Secure data encryption and privacy controls ensuring confidential health information is protected.",
    "Seamless integration potential with existing healthcare provider systems for coordinated care.",
    "Offline access to critical health information, ensuring availability even without internet connectivity."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system 'Arogya Setu Kerala' will function via a mobile application for migrant workers and a web portal for healthcare providers. Workers register using a unique ID (e.g., Aadhaar or a system-generated ID) and can input basic health data, medical history, vaccinations, and prescriptions. Healthcare providers can securely access and update these records with patient consent during consultations. The core technologies include: a mobile app (developed for Android and iOS using Flutter/React Native for cross-platform compatibility), a secure cloud-based database (e.g., AWS S3/RDS, Azure Cosmos DB) for scalable data storage, RESTful APIs for communication between the app and the backend, strong data encryption protocols (e.g., AES-256) for data at rest and in transit, and adherence to health data standards like FHIR for potential interoperability. A machine learning component could analyze anonymized aggregate data for public health insights, while blockchain could be explored for tamper-proof record integrity.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Widespread smartphone penetration among migrant workers in Kerala enables mobile-first solution adoption.",
    "Government initiatives like 'Arogya Keralam' create a supportive ecosystem for digital health.",
    "Utilizing open-source technologies can reduce development costs and accelerate implementation.",
    "Availability of cloud infrastructure and secure API services makes robust system deployment possible."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Reduces healthcare costs by minimizing redundant tests and improving diagnostic accuracy.",
    "Enhances worker productivity and reduces sick days through better health management and preventive care.",
    "Potential for partnerships with NGOs, employers, and government for funding and wider adoption."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Significantly improves health outcomes and quality of life for a vulnerable population segment.",
    "Contributes directly to UN SDGs 3 (Good Health) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities) at a regional level."
  ],
  "beneficiaries": [
    "Migrant workers benefit from continuous, accessible healthcare, reducing health risks and improving well-being.",
    "Healthcare providers gain comprehensive patient history, leading to more accurate diagnoses and effective treatments."
