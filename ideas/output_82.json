  "need_to_know": "Digital Health Records (DHRs) are electronic versions of a patient's medical history, accessible securely. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are UN objectives for global well-being, specifically SDG 3 (Good Health) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) are relevant.",
  "problem_statement": "Migrant workers in Kerala lack a centralized, accessible digital health record system, leading to fragmented care and health disparities. This hinders their access to timely medical services and impacts their overall well-being.",
  "idea": "Our idea is 'Swasthya Seva': a secure, blockchain-powered Digital Health Record system for migrant workers in Kerala, ensuring portable and accessible health data aligned with SDG 3 and 10.",
  "problem_resolution": "Swasthya Seva centralizes health data, enabling seamless access for workers and providers, overcoming language barriers, and reducing treatment delays. It promotes equitable healthcare access for this vulnerable population.",
  "usps": [
    "Blockchain-backed security ensures tamper-proof and private health data, building trust among users and providers.",
    "Multi-language interface with voice input supports diverse linguistic backgrounds of migrant workers.",
    "Offline accessibility via QR codes allows basic health info retrieval even without internet.",
    "Integration with existing public health infrastructure for seamless data exchange and reporting.",
    "Portable health identity across different clinics and states, ensuring continuity of care."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system utilizes a mobile application for migrant workers and a web portal for healthcare providers. Workers register using a unique ID (e.g., Aadhaar or a dedicated migrant ID) and can input basic health data, medical history, and past prescriptions. Healthcare providers can access and update records with worker consent using the web portal. Blockchain technology (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric or Ethereum-based private chain) is employed to store encrypted health records securely as immutable ledger entries, ensuring data integrity and patient privacy. IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) can be used for storing large files like X-rays or reports, with hashes stored on the blockchain. A user-friendly interface supports multiple languages. Machine learning can analyze anonymized data for public health insights. Data is accessible via secure login with multi-factor authentication. QR codes can provide quick access to essential medical alerts.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Existing digital infrastructure in Kerala and smartphone penetration among workers facilitate adoption.",
    "Open-source blockchain frameworks like Hyperledger reduce development costs and accelerate deployment.",
    "Partnerships with local NGOs and government health departments can aid implementation and outreach."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Reduced administrative burden for healthcare providers through digitized records saves operational costs.",
    "Improved public health outcomes can lead to government funding and reduced healthcare expenditures.",
    "Potential for premium features (e.g., teleconsultation) or data analytics services for sustainability."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Significantly improves health access and continuity of care for a vulnerable population, aligning with SDG 3.",
    "Reduces health inequalities and empowers migrant workers with their own health data, supporting SDG 10."
  ],
  "beneficiaries": [
    "Migrant workers in Kerala gain better, more accessible, and continuous healthcare services.",
    "Healthcare providers benefit from streamlined record management, better patient insights, and reduced errors."
