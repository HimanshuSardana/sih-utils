  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system integrates several key technologies. Computer Vision and Machine Learning algorithms are trained on images of various track fittings to accurately identify their type, orientation, and optimal marking location. Once identified, a robotic arm positions a high-precision fiber laser engraver to etch a unique QR code onto the fitting's surface. The QR code contains essential metadata like manufacturing date, material, and serial number. This data is then linked to a central IoT-enabled cloud database for real-time tracking and inventory management. When fittings require inspection or maintenance, mobile devices with QR code scanners can quickly access their history and specifications. The AI continuously learns from marking outcomes, optimizing speed and accuracy over time, making the process highly efficient and automated.",
