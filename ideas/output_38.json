  "need_to_know": "Blue Carbon refers to carbon stored in coastal and marine ecosystems like mangroves, seagrasses, and tidal marshes. A Registry is a system for tracking and recording ownership of carbon credits. MRV System stands for Measurement, Reporting, and Verification, crucial for assessing carbon sequestration.",
  "problem_statement": "Current blue carbon MRV and registry systems lack transparency, trust, and efficiency. Data collection is often manual, prone to errors, and difficult to verify, hindering market growth and investment in crucial coastal conservation efforts.",
  "idea": "Develop a decentralized, blockchain-based Blue Carbon Registry and MRV system. It will ensure transparent, immutable, and verifiable tracking of blue carbon credits, enhancing trust and efficiency in carbon markets.",
  "problem_resolution": "Blockchain ensures data integrity and transparency, addressing the lack of trust and efficiency in current MRV and registry systems. It automates verification processes, reduces fraud, and streamlines credit issuance, boosting market confidence.",
  "usps": [
    "Immutable ledger: All data is permanently recorded, preventing tampering and ensuring auditability.",
    "Enhanced transparency: Publicly verifiable transactions and carbon credit lifecycle tracking.",
    "Streamlined MRV: Automates data collection, reporting, and verification using smart contracts.",
    "Reduced fraud risk: Cryptographic security makes fraudulent claims nearly impossible.",
    "Global accessibility: Enables wider participation and investment in blue carbon projects."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system uses a blockchain network to record blue carbon project data. IoT sensors and satellite imagery collect environmental data (e.g., mangrove growth, tidal marsh health). This data is fed into the blockchain, where smart contracts automatically process and verify it against predefined MRV standards. Once verified, carbon credits are minted as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the blockchain and issued to project developers. Buyers can then purchase these transparently, with all transaction history immutably recorded. Technologies involved include a distributed ledger technology (Blockchain, e.g., Ethereum or Polygon for smart contracts), Internet of Things (IoT) for real-time data acquisition from environmental sensors, satellite imaging for remote monitoring, and potentially Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning for data analysis and anomaly detection in MRV processes.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Blockchain technology is mature for secure data management.",
    "Availability of IoT sensors and satellite imaging for environmental monitoring.",
    "Smart contract development can automate complex MRV logic.",
    "Existing open-source blockchain frameworks facilitate rapid development."

  "viability_points": [
    "Growing demand for verifiable carbon credits and offsets.",
    "Potential to attract impact investors and foster blue carbon economy.",
    "Reduces operational costs for MRV compared to traditional methods."

  "impact_points": [
    "Accelerates funding for vital blue carbon ecosystem restoration and conservation.",
    "Provides a reliable mechanism for climate change mitigation and adaptation."

  "beneficiaries": [
    "Coastal communities benefit from ecosystem protection and economic incentives.",
    "Companies seeking credible carbon offsets for their sustainability goals."
