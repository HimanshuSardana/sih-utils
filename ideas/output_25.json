  "need_to_know": "An E-tongue is an analytical instrument using a sensor array to detect and distinguish tastes, mimicking human perception. Dravya refers to substances, often botanical, used in Ayurvedic medicine, requiring precise identification for efficacy and safety.",
  "problem_statement": "Accurate identification of Ayurvedic Dravyas is often subjective, relies on expert knowledge, and lacks standardization. This leads to inconsistencies in quality and potential adulteration, impacting product efficacy and consumer trust.",
  "idea": "Develop an AI-powered E-tongue system for rapid, objective, and accurate identification of Ayurvedic Dravyas. This system will analyze chemical taste profiles to ensure authenticity and quality control.",
  "problem_resolution": "Our E-tongue provides an objective, fast, and consistent method for Dravya identification. It eliminates reliance on subjective human expertise, enhancing quality control and standardization in Ayurvedic product manufacturing.",
  "usps": [
    "High accuracy and precision in identifying even subtly different Dravyas from complex mixtures.",
    "Rapid analysis, providing identification results within minutes, significantly accelerating quality control processes.",
    "Non-destructive testing, preserving precious and often rare Dravya samples during the identification process.",
    "Objective and standardized identification, eliminating human subjectivity and ensuring consistent quality.",
    "Cost-effective solution for quality control, reducing the need for extensive lab testing and expert hours."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The E-tongue utilizes an array of diverse chemical sensors (e.g., electrochemical, optical, mass-sensitive) designed to react specifically to various chemical compounds present in Dravyas. When a prepared liquid extract of a Dravya is introduced, each sensor generates a unique electrical signal proportional to its interaction with the compounds, creating a 'taste fingerprint' or unique chemical profile. These complex sensor responses are then digitized and fed into a sophisticated machine learning model, such as Artificial Neural Networks or Support Vector Machines. This AI model is pre-trained on a comprehensive database of known Dravya profiles, allowing it to recognize patterns. By comparing the new sample's fingerprint to its vast database, the AI can rapidly and accurately identify the Dravya, detect adulteration, and assess its purity. Key technologies include advanced sensor arrays, high-speed data acquisition systems, and robust machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition and classification.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Existing E-tongue technologies are proven for complex mixture analysis in various industries.",
    "Availability of diverse chemical sensor types suitable for broad-spectrum organic compound detection.",
