  "need_to_know": "An \"E-tongue\" (electronic tongue) is a sensor system designed to mimic human taste, detecting and distinguishing different chemical compounds. \"Dravya\" refers to substances, often botanical or mineral, used in Ayurvedic medicine, which require accurate identification for therapeutic efficacy and safety.",
  "problem_statement": "Accurate identification of Ayurvedic Dravya is critical but challenging. Traditional methods are subjective, time-consuming, and prone to error or adulteration, leading to efficacy and safety concerns in herbal medicine.",
  "idea": "Develop an AI-powered electronic tongue system for rapid, objective, and accurate identification and quality assessment of Ayurvedic Dravya, ensuring authenticity and purity.",
  "problem_resolution": "This E-tongue provides a non-invasive, quick, and objective method for precise Dravya identification. It minimizes human error, combats adulteration, and enhances quality control, ensuring the authenticity of herbal medicines.",
  "usps": [
    "Rapid and real-time identification of complex Dravya compounds' chemical profiles.",
    "High accuracy and objectivity, significantly minimizing human error in material analysis.",
    "Non-destructive testing method, preserving the integrity and quantity of valuable samples.",
    "Cost-effective alternative to traditional, expensive, and time-consuming laboratory analysis.",
    "Portable device enabling on-site quality control and immediate authentication of substances."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The E-tongue system employs an array of chemical and electrochemical sensors designed to react differently to various chemical compounds present in a Dravya sample. When a prepared sample (e.g., a liquid extract) interacts with the sensor array, each sensor generates a unique electrical signal based on its chemical interaction. These raw signals are then processed, and relevant features are extracted. A machine learning (ML) algorithm, such as a neural network or support vector machine, is at the core of the system. This ML model is extensively trained on a vast database of known Dravya samples, correlating specific sensor response patterns with distinct Dravya identities, purity levels, and potential adulterants. When a new, unknown Dravya sample is tested, its sensor response pattern is fed into the trained ML model. The model then performs pattern recognition to identify the Dravya, providing a rapid, objective, and quantitative assessment. Technologies involved include advanced sensor fabrication, data acquisition hardware, and sophisticated AI/ML algorithms for data processing and classification. IoT capabilities could enable cloud-based data storage and analysis.",
