  "need_to_know": "HEIs stands for Higher Education Institutions, referring to universities and colleges. A comprehensive student activity record includes not just academic grades but also extracurriculars, projects, volunteering, awards, certifications, and leadership roles.",
  "problem_statement": "Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) lack a centralized digital platform to comprehensively record and track diverse student activities beyond academics. This leads to fragmented data, making it challenging to get a holistic view of student engagement and achievements.",
  "idea": "A 'Student Activity Hub' \u2013 a centralized digital platform for HEIs to manage, verify, and showcase all student activities, from academic projects to extracurricular involvement, fostering holistic development and verifiable portfolios.",
  "problem_resolution": "This platform consolidates all student data into one secure location, providing a complete, verifiable record. It simplifies tracking, enhances student profiles, and enables HEIs to better assess and support student growth beyond academic metrics.",
  "usps": [
    "Verified activity logs ensuring authenticity and credibility of student participation and achievements.",
    "Holistic student profiles showcasing skills, projects, and leadership, not just academic grades.",
    "Seamless integration capabilities with existing HEI learning management and student information systems.",
    "Personalized skill and interest mapping helping students identify growth areas and opportunities.",
    "Enhanced employability through a robust, verifiable digital portfolio for career and further study applications."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The platform allows students to log various activities such as club participation, project completions, volunteer hours, and awards. Faculty or designated administrators verify these entries, ensuring data accuracy. All verified information is securely stored in a cloud-based database (e.g., AWS, Azure). Students can access a personalized dashboard via a web portal or mobile app to view their complete activity profile, track progress, and generate official, verifiable reports or digital badges. The system will leverage a modern technology stack: a frontend built with React or Angular for a responsive user interface, a backend developed using Node.js with Express.js or Python with Django/Flask for robust API services, a PostgreSQL or MongoDB database for scalable data storage, and potentially blockchain technology for immutable record verification and enhanced trust. APIs will facilitate integration with existing HEI systems like LMS (Learning Management Systems) and SIS (Student Information Systems).",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Leverages existing, mature cloud infrastructure for scalable, secure data storage and processing.",
    "Utilizes widely adopted web and mobile development frameworks, enabling rapid development and deployment.",
    "Integration with university IT systems is achievable through standard API protocols and data exchange methods."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Reduces significant administrative burden on HEI staff by automating student activity record keeping.",
    "Enhances institutional reputation by showcasing comprehensive student success and engagement.",
    "Provides a valuable service to students, improving their academic journey and future career prospects."

  "impact_points": [
    "Revolutionizes student assessment beyond academic grades, recognizing diverse talents and contributions.",
    "Empowers students with a verifiable, comprehensive digital portfolio for future academic and career pursuits."
