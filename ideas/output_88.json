  "need_to_know": "HEIs stands for Higher Education Institutions. A 'comprehensive student activity record' refers to tracking all non-academic involvements like clubs, volunteering, internships, and projects, beyond just grades.",
  "problem_statement": "HEIs lack a unified digital platform to track and manage diverse student activities comprehensively. This leads to fragmented data, difficult reporting, and an incomplete view of student development.",
  "idea": "A centralized digital platform that consolidates all student co-curricular and extracurricular activities, providing a holistic view of their engagement and skill development throughout their academic journey.",
  "problem_resolution": "This platform resolves data fragmentation by creating a single source of truth for student activities. It simplifies tracking, reporting, and enables richer insights into student growth beyond academics.",
  "usps": [
    "Holistic Student Profile: Captures all non-academic achievements, offering a complete picture of student development for future opportunities.",
    "Automated Verification: Streamlines activity approval processes, reducing manual effort for faculty and administrators efficiently.",
    "Skill & Competency Mapping: Automatically maps activities to skills, helping students identify gaps and growth areas effectively.",
    "Data-Driven Insights: Provides analytics for institutions to assess program effectiveness and student engagement trends precisely.",
    "Personalized Student Portfolios: Allows students to showcase their verified activities and skills to potential employers or for further studies."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The platform will be a web-based application, accessible via desktop and mobile, built on a robust cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure). Students will log in to record activities, which are then routed for faculty/mentor verification via a dedicated interface. Administrators can access dashboards for reporting and insights. Key technologies include a secure relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for data storage, RESTful APIs for integration with existing HEI systems (e.g., SIS, LMS), a modern frontend framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js), and potentially AI/ML algorithms for skill inference and personalized activity recommendations based on student profiles and goals.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Leverages existing cloud infrastructure and mature web development technologies for rapid deployment and scalability.",
    "Modular design allows for phased implementation, starting with core features and gradually adding advanced functionalities.",
    "Integration capabilities with current HEI systems via standard APIs minimize disruption and ensure smooth data flow."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Addresses a critical need for HEIs to track and report on student holistic development for accreditation and ranking.",
    "Enhances student engagement by providing a structured way to record and showcase their diverse achievements and skills.",
    "Offers valuable data for institutional planning, resource allocation, and improving student support services effectively."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Significantly improves student employability by providing a verifiable, comprehensive record of skills and experiences beyond academics.",
    "Empowers HEIs with comprehensive data to demonstrate educational effectiveness and student success holistically to stakeholders."
  ],
  "beneficiaries": [
    "Students: Gain a verifiable, comprehensive record of their activities, aiding career development and personal growth.",
    "HEI Administration & Faculty: Streamlined activity management, enhanced reporting, and data-driven insights into student engagement."
