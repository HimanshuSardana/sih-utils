  "how_it_works": "The 'Career Compass' platform utilizes a multi-component architecture. Users input their academic history, skills, interests, and career aspirations via an intuitive interface. A Natural Language Processing (NLP) module processes this textual data to extract key insights. A Machine Learning (ML) recommendation engine, trained on vast datasets of career paths, educational programs, and job market trends, then generates personalized career roadmaps. This engine employs collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to suggest relevant courses, certifications, and skill development resources. For job matching, it integrates with APIs of various job portals and uses semantic search to align user profiles with job descriptions effectively. Big data analytics continuously updates market insights, ensuring recommendations are always current and relevant. A modern user interface (UI) framework (e.g., React, Vue.js) provides an engaging dashboard for users to track progress and explore options. A robust database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) securely stores user profiles, course data, and job listings.",
