  "need_to_know": "\u201cInfection Level\u201d refers to the severity of disease or pest infestation on a plant. A \u201cPesticide Sprinkling System\u201d is used to apply chemical agents to protect plants from pests/diseases, often uniformly.",
  "problem_statement": "Farmers currently apply pesticides uniformly, leading to overuse, environmental harm, and increased costs. A targeted approach based on actual plant health is urgently needed to optimize application.",
  "idea": "Develop an intelligent system that precisely applies pesticides only where and when needed, determined by real-time plant infection levels. This optimizes usage and minimizes waste.",
  "problem_resolution": "This system tackles pesticide overuse and environmental pollution by enabling precise, data-driven application. It reduces costs for farmers and promotes sustainable agricultural practices by targeting only infected areas.",
  "usps": [
    "Precision application significantly reduces pesticide waste, cutting operational costs for farmers.",
    "Minimizes environmental impact by preventing chemical runoff and soil contamination.",
    "Improves crop yield and quality by effectively targeting infected areas with appropriate treatment.",
    "Provides data-driven insights into plant health, enabling proactive disease management and timely intervention.",
    "Automated system reduces manual labor and exposure risks for agricultural workers, improving safety."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system uses a combination of technologies. Drones or robotic platforms equipped with hyperspectral cameras and IoT sensors (e.g., for moisture, temperature) collect real-time data on plant health. Image recognition and AI/ML algorithms analyze this data to detect and quantify plant infection levels, generating precise infection maps. Based on these maps, an integrated precision sprinkling mechanism applies pesticides only to the affected areas, optimizing dosage and coverage. Cloud computing handles large-scale data processing and storage, while a user-friendly interface allows farmers to monitor and control the entire operation.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "AI/ML for image analysis and plant disease detection is a mature and well-established technology.",
    "Drone technology and precision spraying hardware are readily available and widely used in modern agriculture.",
    "IoT sensors provide real-time environmental and plant health data efficiently, supporting data-driven decisions."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Offers significant cost savings for farmers by drastically reducing pesticide consumption and labor.",
    "Addresses growing consumer and regulatory demand for sustainably farmed produce with less chemical input.",
    "Potential to increase crop yields and quality, directly boosting farmer profitability and market competitiveness."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Reduces environmental pollution from chemical runoff, preserving biodiversity and water quality in agricultural areas.",
    "Enhances food safety by minimizing pesticide residues on crops, leading to healthier food for consumers."
  ],
  "beneficiaries": [
    "Farmers benefit from increased efficiency, reduced operational costs, and healthier, more productive crops.",
    "The environment benefits from reduced chemical usage, leading to cleaner soil, water, and ecosystems."
