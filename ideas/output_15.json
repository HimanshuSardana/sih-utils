  "need_to_know": "Infection Level of a Plant refers to the severity and spread of diseases or pests. An Intelligent Pesticide Sprinkling System uses technology to precisely apply pesticides only where and when needed, based on this infection data.",
  "problem_statement": "Farmers currently apply pesticides uniformly, leading to waste, environmental damage, and potential crop harm. There's a need for a system that precisely targets pesticide application based on actual plant infection levels, optimizing usage and minimizing negative impacts.",
  "idea": "Our idea is an AI-powered precision agriculture system. It identifies specific plant infection levels using image analysis and deploys an intelligent sprinkling mechanism to apply pesticides only to affected areas, ensuring efficient and targeted treatment.",
  "problem_resolution": "This system resolves inefficient pesticide use by providing real-time, plant-specific infection data. It enables automated, targeted application, significantly reducing waste, environmental impact, and improving crop health while cutting farmer costs.",
  "usps": [
    "Reduces pesticide consumption by up to 70%, lowering costs and minimizing chemical exposure for workers.",
    "Enhances crop health and yield by preventing widespread infections with timely, precise treatment.",
    "Minimizes environmental pollution by drastically cutting pesticide runoff into soil and water bodies.",
    "Provides data-driven insights into plant health, enabling proactive disease management and optimized farming practices.",
    "Automates the spraying process, saving labor time and ensuring consistent, accurate application across large farms."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system utilizes drones or ground-based robots equipped with high-resolution multispectral cameras to capture images of crops. These images are fed into an AI/ML model (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification and segmentation) which analyzes plant health, identifies disease or pest infection, and determines its severity and exact location. This data is then transmitted via IoT (Internet of Things) devices to a central control unit. Based on the infection map, the intelligent sprinkling system, integrated with precision sprayers and GPS modules, is activated. It uses IoT-enabled nozzles that can be individually controlled to release pesticides only on the identified infected areas, adjusting dosage based on severity. Technologies involved include Computer Vision, Machine Learning, IoT for connectivity, GPS for localization, and precision spraying hardware.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Existing drone technology and high-resolution cameras are readily available and affordable for agricultural use.",
    "Advanced AI/ML frameworks exist for image recognition, enabling rapid development of disease detection models.",
    "IoT communication protocols and precision spraying hardware are mature, making system integration straightforward."
