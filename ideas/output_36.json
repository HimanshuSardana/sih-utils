  "how_it_works": "The sensor uses a focused laser (e.g., 785nm) to illuminate a sample. When microplastics are present, they scatter light, and some light undergoes an inelastic scattering process called Raman scattering. This creates a unique spectral fingerprint for each plastic type. A spectrometer collects this scattered light, and the resulting spectrum is fed into a machine learning model (e.g., a Convolutional Neural Network trained on a database of known microplastic Raman spectra). The AI algorithm identifies the presence, type (e.g., PET, PP, PE), and potentially the size and concentration of microplastics. Key technologies include miniature Raman spectrometers, high-sensitivity detectors, laser modules, and embedded processing units for AI inference.",
