  "how_it_works": "The system begins with comprehensive data collection from various sources including trackside sensors, train-mounted IoT devices, existing signaling systems, GPS data, and real-time weather information. This data feeds into a central AI core, which utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms, primarily reinforcement learning and deep learning, to process patterns, predict train behaviors, and identify optimal control strategies. A dedicated optimization engine, leveraging techniques like genetic algorithms, generates precise train schedules and routes in real time. A digital twin simulation environment continuously models and predicts future states, allowing the AI to test and refine its decisions before implementation. Control commands are then transmitted to trains and signaling infrastructure via low-latency communication networks (e.g., 5G/IoT). Operators interact through a user-friendly HMI, while APIs ensure seamless integration with legacy railway control systems like SCADA. All data storage, processing, and AI model training occur on a robust cloud platform, ensuring scalability and reliability.",
