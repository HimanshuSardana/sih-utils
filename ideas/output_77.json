  "need_to_know": "An electric fence is a barrier that delivers an electric shock to deter animals or people. Unauthorized use refers to tampering, bypassing, or illegally connecting to the fence system.",
  "problem_statement": "Electric fences lack robust detection against tampering or unauthorized connections. This leads to security breaches, property damage, or safety risks from misuse, necessitating a proactive monitoring solution.",
  "idea": "Develop a smart, IoT-enabled hardware module for electric fences. It will actively monitor fence integrity, detect anomalies, and provide instant alerts to prevent unauthorized access or misuse, enhancing security.",
  "problem_resolution": "The IoT module continuously monitors electrical parameters and physical state. It triggers real-time alerts upon detecting tampering or unauthorized connections, enabling immediate intervention and preventing misuse effectively.",
  "usps": [
    "Real-time anomaly detection and instant alerts via mobile app/SMS for rapid response.",
    "AI-powered pattern recognition to differentiate legitimate vs. unauthorized fence events.",
    "Remote monitoring and control of fence parameters and status from any location.",
    "Integrated tamper-proof design with self-diagnostic capabilities for system reliability.",
    "Seamless integration with existing electric fence systems for easy, cost-effective upgrade."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system comprises a microcontroller (e.g., ESP32) connected to various sensors. Voltage and current sensors monitor electrical pulses. Accelerometers/gyroscopes detect physical tampering or fence line movement. Proximity sensors or infrared beams can detect unauthorized approach or wire cutting. A GPS module provides location tracking. A communication module (LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, or cellular) transmits data securely. The microcontroller runs edge processing for basic anomaly detection. Data is then sent to a cloud-based IoT platform (e.g., AWS IoT, Google Cloud IoT). An AI/ML engine in the cloud analyzes historical data to learn normal fence behavior and identify complex unauthorized patterns. An alerting system triggers real-time notifications (SMS, email, push alerts) to users. A mobile application or web dashboard provides remote monitoring and control. Upon detection, the system can activate audible alarms, deterrent lights, or, if legally permissible, temporarily disarm the affected fence section.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Utilizes mature IoT sensor technology and microcontrollers, readily available and cost-effective.",
    "Leverages existing cellular or LoRaWAN networks for reliable, wide-area communication.",
    "Modular design allows easy integration and retrofitting with most standard electric fence setups."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Addresses a clear market need for enhanced security in agriculture, industrial, and residential sectors.",
    "Offers significant cost savings by preventing theft, vandalism, and livestock escapes.",
    "Potential for subscription-based services for cloud monitoring, advanced analytics, and support."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Significantly enhances security, reducing property loss, illegal entry, and safety hazards proactively.",
    "Provides peace of mind to property owners through proactive monitoring and rapid response capabilities."
  ],
  "beneficiaries": [
    "Farmers and ranchers protecting livestock, crops, and equipment from theft or predators.",
    "Property owners, businesses, and industrial sites seeking robust perimeter security solutions."
