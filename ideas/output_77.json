  "need_to_know": "Electric fences are barriers that use high voltage to deter trespassers or contain livestock. Unauthorized use refers to tampering, bypassing, or attempting to steal components.",
  "problem_statement": "Existing electric fences lack real-time monitoring, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access, tampering, or theft. This leads to security breaches, property damage, and potential safety hazards.",
  "idea": "Develop a smart, IoT-enabled hardware device that integrates with existing electric fences to provide real-time monitoring, intrusion detection, and automated alert systems to prevent unauthorized use.",
  "problem_resolution": "Our device proactively detects anomalies like voltage drops, cuts, or bypass attempts. It instantly alerts property owners, enabling quick intervention and preventing security breaches.",
  "usps": [
    "Real-time, remote monitoring of fence integrity from anywhere via a mobile app.",
    "AI-powered anomaly detection to differentiate true threats from false alarms.",
    "Modular design ensures easy integration with existing electric fence systems.",
    "Automated alerts and customizable response protocols for rapid intervention.",
    "Low power consumption and solar charging options for continuous operation."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system involves various sensors and technologies. Current sensors monitor the electrical pulses of the fence, detecting voltage drops or breaks. Capacitive or vibration sensors can detect physical tampering or attempts to climb. A microcontroller (e.g., ESP32 or Arduino) processes sensor data. This data is transmitted via Wi-Fi, cellular (GSM/LTE), or LoRaWAN to a cloud platform. The cloud platform uses machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns, identify anomalies, and trigger alerts. Users receive notifications via a mobile app or SMS. Actuators could potentially trigger sirens or lights. GPS modules could track device location if stolen.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Off-the-shelf sensors and microcontrollers are readily available and affordable, reducing development costs.",
    "Existing IoT platforms and communication protocols simplify data transmission, processing, and alert management.",
    "Basic AI/ML models for anomaly detection are well-documented and implementable with open-source libraries."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Significant market need exists for enhanced security in agriculture, industrial sites, and private properties.",
    "Potential for a recurring subscription-based model for cloud monitoring and advanced features, ensuring sustained revenue.",
    "Scalable solution, easily adaptable to various electric fence types and sizes across different sectors."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Significantly enhances property security by proactively deterring theft, vandalism, and unauthorized access.",
    "Reduces financial losses for owners from property damage, livestock theft, and security breaches."
  ],
  "beneficiaries": [
    "Farmers and ranchers protecting valuable livestock and crops from trespassers and poachers.",
    "Industrial sites, critical infrastructure, and private property owners seeking robust perimeter security."
