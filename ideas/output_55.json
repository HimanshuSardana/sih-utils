  "need_to_know": "IS 10810 and IS 7098 are Indian Standards specifying test methods for electrical cables, including specimen preparation. Specimen preparation involves precisely cutting, stripping, and preparing cable samples for various mechanical and electrical tests according to these standards.",
  "problem_statement": "Manual preparation of cable samples for testing as per IS 10810 and IS 7098 is time-consuming, prone to errors, and lacks consistency, hindering efficient quality control and product development.",
  "idea": "Develop an automated robotic system for precise and consistent preparation of cable specimens, streamlining the testing process for electrical cables according to Indian Standards IS 10810 and IS 7098.",
  "problem_resolution": "This system eliminates manual inconsistencies, reduces human error, and significantly accelerates the preparation phase, ensuring high accuracy and compliance with stringent IS standards for cable testing.",
  "usps": [
    "Achieves high precision and repeatability in specimen dimensions, crucial for accurate test results.",
    "Significantly reduces human intervention, minimizing labor costs and potential for manual errors.",
    "Accelerates the sample preparation workflow, enabling faster testing cycles and product time-to-market.",
    "Guarantees strict adherence to specified Indian Standards for cable testing, ensuring regulatory compliance.",
