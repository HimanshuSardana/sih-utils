  "how_it_works": "The Automated Specimen Preparation System integrates several advanced technologies. Raw cable samples are fed into the system, either manually or via an automated feeder. High-resolution computer vision cameras scan the cable, identifying its type, diameter, and required cut lengths based on pre-programmed IS 10810 and IS 7098 specifications stored in a database. A multi-axis robotic arm then precisely manipulates and positions the cable. Precision cutting tools, such as laser cutters or specialized blades, cut the cable into exact specimen lengths. Simultaneously, an automated marking system (e.g., laser etching or inkjet) applies unique identification codes or test parameters to each specimen. A secondary vision system performs a post-cut quality check, verifying dimensions and surface integrity. Finally, the prepared and verified specimens are automatically sorted into designated trays or moved to the next testing station. Technologies involved include: industrial robotic arms (e.g., collaborative robots for safety and flexibility), machine vision cameras and software (e.g., OpenCV, proprietary algorithms for pattern recognition and measurement), precision linear actuators and motors for cutting mechanisms, laser or blade cutting modules, PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) or microcontroller for overall system control, and an HMI (Human-Machine Interface) for user interaction, recipe management, and data reporting.",
