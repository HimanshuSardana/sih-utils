  "need_to_know": "Low Voltage AC Distribution Over Head conductors are the power lines that deliver electricity from distribution transformers to homes and businesses, typically at voltages below 1000V. Breakage detection refers to identifying when these conductors snap or fall, which can cause power outages and safety hazards.",
  "problem_statement": "The problem is to develop an inexpensive and efficient method for identifying breaks in overhead low voltage AC distribution conductors. Current methods are often manual, slow, and costly, leading to prolonged outages and safety risks.",

  "how_it_works": "The system employs a network of small, low-power acoustic and/or vibration sensors strategically placed along the Low Voltage AC Distribution Over Head conductors. These sensors continuously monitor for abnormal sounds or vibrations indicative of a conductor breaking or falling. When a potential breakage event is detected, the sensor data is wirelessly transmitted using low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies like LoRaWAN or NB-IoT to a central gateway. From the gateway, the data is sent to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS IoT, Google Cloud IoT) for processing. An Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML) model, trained on various breakage signatures, analyzes the incoming sensor data in real-time to confirm a breakage event. Upon confirmation, an alert is immediately sent to utility operators via SMS, email, or integrated SCADA systems, pinpointing the exact location of the fault. The system leverages edge computing for initial data filtering to reduce bandwidth usage and latency.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Low-cost IoT sensors and LPWAN communication technologies are mature and readily available for large-scale deployment.",
    "AI/ML models can be effectively trained to differentiate conductor breakage events from environmental noise with high accuracy.",
