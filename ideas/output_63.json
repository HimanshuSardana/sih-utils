  "how_it_works": "Small, self-powered inductive current sensors are attached to each Low Voltage AC conductor segment. These sensors continuously monitor current flow and impedance. A sudden drop in current to zero or a significant impedance change indicates a breakage. Data from these sensors is transmitted wirelessly using a low-power, long-range protocol like LoRaWAN or NB-IoT to nearby gateways. These gateways then forward the data to a central cloud platform (e.g., AWS IoT, Azure IoT). On the cloud platform, an AI/Machine Learning model, trained on historical current data and breakage patterns, analyzes the incoming sensor data in real-time. Upon detecting a confirmed breakage, the system triangulates the location using signal strength or predefined segment IDs and immediately dispatches alerts to utility operators via SMS, email, or SCADA integration. Technologies involved include low-power microcontrollers (e.g., ESP32, STM32L series) for sensor processing, LoRaWAN/NB-IoT modules for communication, cloud-based IoT platforms for data ingestion and processing, and Python with TensorFlow/PyTorch for the AI/ML analytics engine.",
