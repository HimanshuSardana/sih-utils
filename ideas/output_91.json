  "how_it_works": "The platform will leverage cloud-based CAD/CAM software (like Fusion 360 for design, simulation, and NC code generation). Students receive a problem statement for an industrial component. They design in CAD, create toolpaths in CAM, and generate NC code. A virtual machining simulator, potentially utilizing WebGL or a similar rendering engine, will visualize the machining process based on the generated G-code. AI/ML algorithms can analyze toolpath efficiency and suggest optimizations. A database of machine details and tool libraries will ensure accurate code generation. Version control (e.g., Git) will manage project iterations, and a feedback system will provide insights from mentors. Key technologies: Fusion 360 APIs, cloud computing, virtual simulation (WebGL/Unity/Unreal), AI/ML for optimization, database management, and a web-based user interface.",
