  "need_to_know": "NAMASTE is India's National AYUSH Morbidity And Standardized Terminologies Electronic portal. ICD-11 is the World Health Organization's global standard for health information, including Traditional Medicine Module 2 (TM2). EMR systems store patient medical records digitally. EHR Standards for India are national guidelines for electronic health records.",
  "problem_statement": "Existing Indian EMRs lack integration with NAMASTE and ICD-11 TM2. This leads to fragmented traditional medicine data, hindering standardization and compliance with national EHR standards.",
  "idea": "Develop a secure, scalable API gateway and middleware solution to seamlessly integrate NAMASTE and ICD-11 TM2 into diverse EMR systems compliant with India's EHR standards for unified healthcare data.",
  "problem_resolution": "Our API solution bridges the gap, enabling EMRs to exchange and classify traditional medicine data using standardized terminologies (NAMASTE, ICD-11 TM2), ensuring compliance and unified patient records for better care.",
  "usps": [
    "Seamless integration for traditional medicine data within existing EMR workflows.",
    "Ensures full compliance with India's EHR standards and global ICD-11 TM2.",
    "Reduces manual data entry and classification errors for healthcare providers.",
    "Enhances data quality and interoperability for AYUSH and traditional medicine.",
    "Scalable and secure architecture designed for diverse EMR environments."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The solution involves developing a set of RESTful APIs that act as an intermediary layer. It will accept traditional medicine data from EMR systems, map it to NAMASTE and ICD-11 TM2 terminologies, and allow EMRs to query these standardized codes. Key technologies include: RESTful APIs for communication; JSON for data exchange; a Data Mapping Engine to translate EMR data fields to NAMASTE/ICD-11 TM2 codes and vice-versa, potentially using ontologies or machine learning; robust Security Protocols like OAuth2.0 and HTTPS to ensure data privacy and compliance with Indian data protection laws; and Cloud Infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure) for scalable deployment and high availability. A database will store mapping rules, logs, and a cache of standardized codes.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Leverages existing API development best practices and established healthcare interoperability standards.",
    "Modular design allows for incremental integration with various EMR systems without major overhauls.",
    "Open-source libraries and cloud infrastructure can accelerate development and deployment phases."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Strong government push for digital health and AYUSH integration in India creates market demand.",
    "Addresses a critical need for standardization in traditional medicine records for better healthcare.",
    "Potential for a recurring revenue model through subscription-based services for EMR vendors."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Improves clinical decision-making and patient safety through standardized and comprehensive data.",
    "Facilitates robust research, policy-making, and public health initiatives in traditional medicine."
  ],
  "beneficiaries": [
    "Healthcare providers and AYUSH practitioners gain streamlined data management and compliance with national standards.",
    "Patients benefit from integrated, comprehensive, and accurate health records across traditional and modern medicine."
  ],
  "original_problem_statement": "Develop API code to integrate NAMASTE and or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) via the Traditional Medicine Module 2 (TM2) into existing EMR systems that comply with Electronic Health Record (EHR) Standards for India.",
