  "need_to_know": "NAMASTE (National AYUSH Morbidity And Standardized Terminologies Electronic) is a portal for Traditional Indian Medicine. ICD-11 (International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision) includes the TM2 (Traditional Medicine Module 2) for classifying traditional medicine conditions. EMR (Electronic Medical Records) systems manage patient data. EHR Standards for India refers to guidelines for digital health records in the country.",
  "problem_statement": "Existing Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems in India lack standardized integration with NAMASTE and ICD-11 (TM2). This gap hinders the proper documentation and exchange of traditional medicine data, preventing comprehensive patient care and compliance with India's Electronic Health Record (EHR) standards.",
  "idea": "Develop a robust API integration layer to seamlessly connect NAMASTE and ICD-11 (TM2) with existing EMR systems compliant with Indian EHR standards. This will facilitate standardized documentation and data exchange for traditional medicine practices within digital health records.",
  "problem_resolution": "This API layer standardizes traditional medicine data within EMRs, improving data accuracy, interoperability, and reporting. It ensures compliance with national and international coding standards, enhancing holistic patient care, research, and adherence to Indian EHR guidelines.",
  "usps": [
    "Seamlessly integrates traditional medicine data with modern EMR systems.",
    "Ensures compliance with WHO ICD-11 TM2 and NAMASTE for standardized data.",
    "Enhances interoperability for improved data exchange across healthcare platforms.",
    "Future-proof solution designed to adapt to evolving Indian EHR standards.",
    "Supports holistic patient care by incorporating traditional health records."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The solution involves developing a set of secure, RESTful APIs that act as a bridge between existing EMR systems and the NAMASTE/ICD-11 TM2 databases. When an EMR system needs to record or retrieve information related to traditional medicine, it sends a request to these APIs. The APIs then query the respective NAMASTE or ICD-11 TM2 databases, retrieve the standardized codes or terminologies, and return them to the EMR system. This ensures that traditional medicine data is consistently classified and stored in line with national and international standards. Technologies involved include: RESTful APIs for communication; JSON for data exchange; OAuth2 or API keys for secure authentication; microservices architecture for scalability; and potentially cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure) for hosting the API services, ensuring high availability and performance. The architecture would also consider FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) for broader health data exchange compatibility.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Existing EMR systems commonly support API integrations, simplifying technical implementation.",
    "NAMASTE and ICD-11 TM2 provide well-defined data structures suitable for API mapping.",
    "Modern API development tools and frameworks streamline development and deployment processes."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Addresses a critical gap in standardizing traditional medicine data within EMRs for better outcomes.",
    "Supports government initiatives like Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) promoting digital health.",
    "Enhances research capabilities by providing structured, standardized data on traditional medicine practices."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Revolutionizes traditional medicine documentation by integrating it into mainstream digital health records.",
    "Empowers data-driven policy making and research in AYUSH by providing rich, standardized datasets."
  ],
  "beneficiaries": [
    "Healthcare providers: Simplifies documentation, ensures compliance, and improves holistic patient care.",
    "Patients: Benefits from comprehensive, integrated health records for better-informed treatment decisions."
