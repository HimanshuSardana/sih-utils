  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system leverages AI and Machine Learning algorithms to process extensive input data including course requirements, faculty availability, classroom features (e.g., lab equipment, capacity), and student enrollment numbers. A cloud-based platform (e.g., AWS, Azure) hosts the core application, enabling scalability and accessibility. IoT sensors deployed in smart classrooms provide real-time data on occupancy, temperature, and lighting conditions. This data is fed into a central database and used by the ML model to continuously learn from usage patterns, refine future schedules, and automatically adjust classroom settings for optimal learning environments. APIs facilitate seamless integration with existing student information systems (SIS) and other institutional platforms. The backend is typically built with Python or Java, interacting with a robust SQL or NoSQL database, while the frontend is developed using modern frameworks like React or Angular for an interactive user interface.",
