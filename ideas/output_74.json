  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system utilizes AI (Machine Learning, Deep Learning) to process data from various sources: satellite imagery for crop health, weather APIs for forecasts, IoT sensors in fields for soil conditions (moisture, pH, nutrients), and agricultural databases for crop-specific information. Farmers input crop type and stage via a mobile app. The AI analyzes this data to provide personalized recommendations on irrigation schedules, optimal fertilization, pest and disease identification with suggested remedies, and harvest timing. Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables voice commands and chatbot interactions in local languages. Computer Vision aids in analyzing crop images for issues. Data is stored in a cloud database (e.g., AWS, Azure) and processed using ML frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).",
  "feasibility_points": [
