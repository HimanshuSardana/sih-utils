  "problem_statement": "Inefficient management of grey water leads to wastage and environmental strain. Poor wetland management further exacerbates water quality issues. There is an urgent need for integrated solutions for water conservation and sustainable reuse.",
  "idea": "A comprehensive system leveraging constructed wetlands for grey water treatment and reuse. This approach will reduce fresh water demand, improve local ecosystems, and promote sustainable water management practices.",
  "problem_resolution": "This idea addresses the problem by treating grey water through natural wetland systems, making it suitable for non-potable uses. This conserves fresh water, reduces discharge pollution, and creates valuable green spaces.",

  "how_it_works": "Grey water from households or buildings is collected and directed to a pre-treatment unit for removing large solids and grease. This partially treated water then flows into a constructed wetland system, which consists of a lined basin filled with various media (e.g., gravel, sand) and emergent aquatic plants (e.g., reeds, cattails). The plants' roots provide surfaces for microbial growth, and these microorganisms naturally break down pollutants in the water. The wetland acts as a natural biological filter, removing organic matter, suspended solids, and nutrients through physical, chemical, and biological processes like filtration, adsorption, and microbial degradation (e.g., nitrification/denitrification). After passing through the wetland, the treated water can be collected in a storage tank. Depending on the intended reuse purpose (e.g., irrigation, toilet flushing), further disinfection (e.g., UV-C light, chlorination) may be applied. Technologies involved include collection plumbing, coarse filters, pumps, constructed wetland cells, various wetland plant species, and potentially UV disinfection units or simple chlorination systems.",
