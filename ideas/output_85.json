  "need_to_know": "Grey water refers to wastewater from sinks, showers, and laundry, excluding toilet water. Wetland management involves the conservation and restoration of natural or constructed wetlands, which act as natural filters and crucial ecosystems.",
  "problem_statement": "Global water scarcity and environmental degradation necessitate effective grey water management, reuse, and sustainable wetland conservation to ensure long-term water security.",
  "idea": "An integrated smart grey water recycling system combined with constructed wetlands to treat, reuse, and conserve water resources efficiently for residential and community applications.",
  "problem_resolution": "This system efficiently treats grey water, significantly reduces fresh water demand for non-potable uses, and enhances ecological health through natural filtration in constructed wetlands.",
  "usps": [
    "Eco-friendly approach utilizing natural processes for water treatment and purification, reducing chemical dependency.",
    "Reduces household water bills by providing a sustainable alternative for non-potable uses like irrigation and flushing.",
    "Scalable and modular design suitable for both individual homes and community-level implementation, ensuring adaptability.",
    "Enhances local biodiversity and creates green spaces through integrated constructed wetlands, improving aesthetics.",
    "Smart monitoring system ensures optimal performance and real-time water quality assessment, ensuring safety and efficiency."

  "how_it_works": "Grey water from sources like showers, sinks, and washing machines is collected and directed through an initial physical filtration stage (e.g., mesh screens, sand filters) to remove larger particles. The pre-treated water then flows into a constructed wetland, which is an engineered system designed to mimic natural wetlands. Here, specific aquatic plants (e.g., reeds, cattails) and a diverse microbial community living in the root zone and substrate biologically break down and filter out pollutants (nutrients, organic matter, pathogens) through processes like adsorption, nitrification, and denitrification. IoT sensors are integrated to monitor key parameters such as water levels, flow rates, pH, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen at various stages, allowing for real-time performance tracking and system optimization. The treated water, now safe for non-potable uses, is collected in a storage tank and can be pumped for irrigation, toilet flushing, car washing, or released to recharge groundwater, further contributing to water conservation. Key technologies involve smart sensors, low-power pumps, bio-filtration media, and a selection of native wetland plant species suited for bioremediation.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Utilizes well-established filtration and bioremediation technologies, ensuring technical viability and reliability.",
    "Modular design allows for easy implementation and scaling across different property sizes and community needs.",
    "Availability of materials, plant species, and technical expertise for constructing wetlands is widespread.",
    "Government incentives and policies often support water-saving technologies, aiding adoption."
