  "need_to_know": "Blockchain is a decentralized, immutable ledger for secure data. Supply chain transparency ensures full traceability of agricultural produce, from farm to fork, verifying origin, quality, and ethical practices.",
  "problem_statement": "Lack of transparency in agricultural supply chains leads to food fraud, quality concerns, and difficulty in tracing origin. Consumers often don't know where their food comes from or how it was produced, eroding trust.",
  "idea": "Develop a blockchain platform to provide end-to-end traceability for agricultural produce. This ensures transparency by recording every step, from farming to consumer, enhancing trust and verifying product authenticity.",
  "problem_resolution": "The blockchain platform creates an immutable record for each product's journey, making it impossible to tamper with data. This ensures consumers, farmers, and retailers have verifiable information, resolving trust and transparency issues.",
  "usps": [
    "Enhanced consumer trust through verifiable product origin and journey.",
    "Reduced food fraud and counterfeiting with immutable blockchain records.",
    "Improved supply chain efficiency and accountability for all stakeholders.",
    "Fairer pricing and better returns for farmers by showcasing authenticity.",
    "Quick recall capabilities, pinpointing affected batches precisely."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system uses a blockchain network (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric) as the immutable ledger. Farmers log initial produce details and harvest data. IoT sensors monitor environmental conditions (temperature, humidity) during storage and transit, automatically recording data onto the blockchain via smart contracts. Each hand-off (from farm to processor, processor to distributor, distributor to retailer) is recorded as a transaction, verified by smart contracts. Unique QR codes or RFID tags linked to each product batch allow consumers to scan and access its entire history, including origin, quality checks, and transit details, ensuring full transparency. Data is cryptographically secured, preventing tampering.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Existing blockchain platforms (e.g., Hyperledger) provide robust infrastructure.",
    "IoT sensor technology is mature and readily available for agricultural monitoring.",
    "QR code and RFID integration is widely adopted and cost-effective for tracking."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Growing consumer demand for ethical sourcing and transparent food systems.",
    "Potential for premium pricing on verified, high-quality agricultural products.",
    "Reduced compliance risks and improved brand reputation for participating businesses."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Empowers consumers with full knowledge, driving demand for sustainable practices.",
    "Transforms agricultural supply chains into trusted, efficient, and equitable ecosystems."
  ],
  "beneficiaries": [
    "Consumers: Gain trust in food origin, quality, and ethical production.",
    "Farmers: Achieve better prices and recognition for quality and sustainable practices."
