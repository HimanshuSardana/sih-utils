  "need_to_know": "Blockchain is a distributed, immutable ledger system for secure and transparent record-keeping. Supply Chain Transparency in agriculture means knowing the complete journey of produce from farm to fork, ensuring authenticity and quality.",
  "problem_statement": "Current agricultural supply chains suffer from a lack of transparency, leading to food fraud, inefficient recall processes, and unfair practices for farmers. Consumers often lack trust in the origin and quality of their produce.",
  "idea": "Implement a blockchain-based platform to create an immutable and transparent record of agricultural produce throughout its entire supply chain, from initial harvest to the final consumer purchase.",
  "problem_resolution": "The blockchain platform ensures every step of the produce journey is securely and transparently recorded. This builds consumer trust, reduces fraud, and empowers farmers with verifiable product history and fair compensation.",
  "usps": [
    "Provides end-to-end immutable traceability for all agricultural products.",
    "Enhances consumer trust through verifiable product origin and journey details.",
    "Reduces food fraud significantly and enables more efficient recall management.",
    "Ensures fairer compensation for farmers via verifiable quality and origin proof.",
    "Offers improved data integrity and robust security across the entire supply chain."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system utilizes blockchain technology (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric or Ethereum), IoT sensors, smart contracts, and unique identifiers like QR codes or NFC tags. Farmers register their produce batches, providing details like harvest date and location. IoT sensors monitor conditions (temperature, humidity) during transport and storage, automatically recording data onto the blockchain. Each transfer of custody (e.g., to packer, distributor, retailer) is recorded as a transaction, creating an immutable log. Smart contracts can automate payments or trigger alerts for quality deviations. Consumers can scan a product's QR code to access its complete, verifiable journey and history.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Existing robust blockchain frameworks and IoT hardware are readily available for integration.",
    "Successful pilot projects in other industries prove blockchain's technical viability for supply chains.",
    "Cloud infrastructure offers scalable and cost-effective deployment options for the platform.",
    "Growing industry and regulatory interest in blockchain for traceability solutions."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Strong consumer demand for transparently sourced, ethical, and safe food products.",
    "Increasing regulatory pressure for enhanced food safety and traceability standards.",
    "Potential for significant cost savings by reducing fraud and improving supply chain efficiency."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Revolutionizes food safety and significantly boosts consumer trust in agricultural products globally.",
    "Empowers small farmers and producers by ensuring fair value and broader market access."
  ],
  "beneficiaries": [
    "Consumers gain access to verifiable, safe, and ethically sourced food products with confidence.",
    "Farmers and producers receive fair compensation and an enhanced reputation for their quality produce."
