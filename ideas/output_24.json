  "need_to_know": "Ayurvedic Dietitians are practitioners who apply Ayurvedic principles to dietary recommendations. Ayurveda-Focused Diet Plans are meal plans designed based on an individual's Dosha (Vata, Pitta, Kapha) and Ayurvedic principles. Practice Management refers to tools for scheduling, client records, and billing. Nutrient Analysis Software evaluates the nutritional content of food.",
  "problem_statement": "Ayurvedic dietitians lack integrated cloud-based software for practice management and nutrient analysis tailored to Ayurveda. Existing generic tools make it difficult to efficiently create and manage specific, personalized diet plans according to Ayurvedic principles.",

  "how_it_works": "AyurNutriCare leverages a robust cloud infrastructure like AWS or Azure for high availability and scalability. The front-end is developed using a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React or Angular) to provide an intuitive and responsive user interface across devices. The back-end is built with a powerful server-side language (e.g., Python with Django or Node.js with Express) and interacts with a PostgreSQL database. This database stores client profiles, consultation notes, appointment schedules, billing information, and a specialized Ayurvedic food database. This custom database integrates traditional Ayurvedic properties (like Rasa, Virya, Vipaka, Guna) with modern nutritional data. A core logic engine processes client Dosha profiles and other parameters to generate personalized diet recommendations. API integrations are used for payment processing (e.g., Stripe) and potentially for video conferencing. Data security is paramount, employing industry-standard encryption, access controls, and regular backups to protect sensitive health information.",
