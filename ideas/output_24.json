  "need_to_know": "Ayurveda is an ancient Indian holistic healing system. Ayurvedic Dietitians apply these principles to nutrition, creating diet plans tailored to individual Dosha (body constitution). Cloud-Based Practice Management software helps professionals manage patient records, appointments, and billing online. Nutrient Analysis Software evaluates the nutritional content of food.",
  "problem_statement": "Ayurvedic dietitians lack an integrated cloud-based solution for practice management and nutrient analysis. Current tools don't cater to unique Ayurvedic principles, Dosha-specific diets, or traditional food properties, leading to inefficiencies and challenges in personalized patient care.",

  ],
  "how_it_works": "AyurConnect operates on a secure cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure) for scalability and global accessibility. Dietitians input patient Dosha assessments, health goals, and conditions. An AI/ML engine then leverages a proprietary database of Ayurvedic food properties (Gunas, Vipaka, Virya) and traditional recipes to generate highly personalized diet plans. This engine ensures recommendations align with the patient's specific Dosha (Vata, Pitta, Kapha) and seasonal needs. The platform also integrates standard nutritional data with Ayurvedic properties for a holistic view. Core modules include: Electronic Health Records (EHR) tailored for Ayurvedic consultations, appointment scheduling, billing, and secure patient messaging. Patients access their plans and track progress via a dedicated portal. Key technologies involve: Cloud computing platforms, a robust database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for Ayurvedic food data, AI/ML frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) for the recommendation engine, and secure APIs for potential third-party integrations. Frontend development uses modern web frameworks (e.g., React, Angular) with a backend in Python (Django) or Node.js (Express).",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Existing cloud infrastructure and mature AI/ML technologies make development achievable.",
    "A wealth of Ayurvedic knowledge can be digitized and integrated into the database.",
    "Skilled software development teams are readily available to build and deploy the platform."
