  "how_it_works": "The system involves IoT sensors (soil moisture, pH, temperature) deployed across various farm plots in hilly areas, transmitting real-time data. Drones with multispectral cameras conduct aerial surveys for crop health, disease detection, and terrain mapping. This data is fed into an AI-driven analytics platform that processes information to provide actionable insights. Machine learning algorithms predict optimal planting times, irrigation schedules, and nutrient requirements based on terrain, weather, and crop type. Automated drip irrigation systems, controlled by the platform, deliver water precisely. Robotic devices or automated sprayers, guided by GPS and sensor data, can apply pesticides or fertilizers accurately. Farmers access a user-friendly dashboard via mobile or web, receiving alerts and recommendations. Technologies involved include IoT, AI/ML, drone technology, cloud computing for data storage and processing, and precision irrigation hardware.",
