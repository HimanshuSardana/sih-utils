  "how_it_works": "IoT sensors (soil moisture, pH, temperature, nutrient levels, localized weather stations) are strategically deployed across hilly farms to collect real-time data. This data is transmitted via low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) like LoRaWAN to a cloud-based platform. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms analyze this aggregated data to generate precise recommendations for irrigation scheduling, fertilization needs, and pest/disease detection. Drones equipped with multispectral cameras conduct aerial surveys to monitor crop health, identify stress areas, and map terrain for optimal planting. Automated systems, such as smart drip irrigation valves, robotic sprayers for targeted pesticide/herbicide application, and climate-controlled greenhouses, then execute these AI-driven recommendations. This continuous feedback loop ensures dynamic optimization of resources and proactive problem-solving, all adapted to the unique topography and microclimates of hilly regions.",
