  "need_to_know": "Biosecurity measures are practices implemented on farms to prevent the introduction and spread of disease-causing organisms. This is crucial for maintaining animal health, preventing epidemics, and ensuring food safety in pig and poultry farming.",
  "problem_statement": "Farmers struggle with consistent implementation and monitoring of biosecurity measures in pig and poultry farms. Manual processes are inefficient, lack real-time data, and lead to potential disease outbreaks and significant economic losses.",
  "idea": "A digital farm management portal offering real-time biosecurity monitoring, compliance tracking, and data analytics. This platform helps farmers effectively manage and adhere to crucial biosecurity protocols.",
  "problem_resolution": "The portal automates biosecurity tracking, provides real-time alerts for non-compliance, and offers data-driven insights. This significantly enhances adherence to protocols, preventing disease spread and improving overall farm productivity.",
  "usps": [
    "Real-time monitoring and automated alerts for biosecurity breaches.",
    "Customizable biosecurity protocols tailored to specific farm needs.",
    "Integrated data analytics for identifying disease risk patterns early.",
    "User-friendly interface accessible on mobile and web platforms.",
    "Enhanced traceability of animals and personnel for better control."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The digital portal integrates various technologies: IoT sensors monitor environmental factors (temperature, humidity, air quality) and animal behavior. RFID/NFC tags track animal movements and personnel access to restricted zones. Computer vision algorithms analyze video feeds for anomaly detection, such as signs of illness or unauthorized entry. All data is securely collected, processed, and stored in a cloud-based database (e.g., AWS, Azure). A backend system (e.g., Python with Django, Node.js with Express) handles data processing, logic, and API management. A user-friendly frontend (web and mobile application built with React, Flutter, or similar frameworks) provides dashboards, alerts, and reporting. Machine learning models analyze historical and real-time data to predict potential risks and offer actionable insights to farmers for proactive disease management.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Existing IoT hardware and cloud infrastructure are readily available and affordable.",
    "Digitizing standard biosecurity protocols is straightforward and implementable.",
    "Widespread smartphone adoption ensures easy access for farmers.",
    "Technologies like computer vision are becoming more accessible."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Reduces disease outbreaks significantly, saving farmers substantial costs.",
    "Meets increasing consumer demand for safe and traceable food products.",
    "Subscription model ensures recurring revenue and sustainable growth.",
    "Improves farm operational efficiency and compliance with regulations."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Significantly improves animal welfare and contributes to public health by preventing zoonotic diseases.",
    "Boosts farm productivity and economic stability, ensuring food security for the region."
  ],
  "beneficiaries": [
    "Pig and poultry farmers benefit from enhanced disease prevention, operational efficiency, and reduced losses.",
    "Consumers benefit from safer, higher-quality food products and reduced risks of foodborne illnesses."
