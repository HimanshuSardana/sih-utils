  "need_to_know": "Urban Congestion refers to excessive traffic volumes leading to slower speeds, longer travel times, and increased vehicle queuing. A Smart Traffic Management System uses technology to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion.",
  "problem_statement": "Urban centers face severe traffic congestion, causing wasted time, increased pollution, and economic losses. Inefficient manual traffic control struggles to adapt to dynamic road conditions.",
  "idea": "Develop an AI-powered Smart Traffic Management System that uses real-time data to dynamically optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance urban mobility.",
  "problem_resolution": "The system dynamically adjusts traffic signals and routes based on real-time data, significantly reducing bottlenecks and travel times. It also prioritizes emergency vehicles effectively.",
  "usps": [
    "Dynamic signal timing adapts to real-time traffic conditions, optimizing flow instantly.",
    "AI-driven predictive analytics anticipate congestion, enabling proactive measures.",
    "Prioritizes emergency vehicles, reducing response times in critical situations.",
    "Integrates with public transport, promoting multimodal urban mobility.",
    "Reduces carbon emissions and fuel consumption by minimizing vehicle idling."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system utilizes a network of IoT sensors (e.g., radar, lidar, loop detectors), CCTV cameras, and GPS data from vehicles to collect real-time traffic information. This data is fed into a cloud-based platform where AI and Machine Learning algorithms (e.g., reinforcement learning, neural networks) analyze patterns, predict congestion, and calculate optimal traffic signal timings. The AI models communicate with smart traffic lights and digital signage via secure network protocols (e.g., 5G, LoRaWAN) to adjust timings, manage lane usage, and suggest alternative routes. Predictive analytics anticipates future traffic surges based on historical data, events, and weather. A central dashboard provides real-time monitoring and control for city authorities.",
