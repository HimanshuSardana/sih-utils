  "need_to_know": "Small and Marginal Farmers: Farmers owning less than 2 hectares of land, often with limited resources. Crop Advisory System: Provides guidance and recommendations for various aspects of crop management, from planting to harvesting.",
  "problem_statement": "Small and marginal farmers lack timely, accurate information on crop management, soil health, and weather. This leads to suboptimal yields, financial losses, and food insecurity due to uninformed agricultural decisions.",
  "idea": "An AI-powered Smart Crop Advisory System providing personalized, real-time recommendations to small and marginal farmers. It optimizes crop selection, resource management, and pest control for improved yield and income.",
  "problem_resolution": "This system provides data-driven, localized advice, bridging the information gap for farmers. It optimizes resource use, reduces crop losses, and enhances productivity, leading to increased income and sustainable agricultural practices.",
  "usps": [
    "Hyper-localized real-time weather and soil data analysis for precise crop recommendations.",
    "AI-driven pest and disease identification with integrated, actionable mitigation strategies.",
    "User-friendly mobile interface supporting multiple local languages for easy accessibility.",
    "Cost-effective solutions tailored specifically for resource-constrained small and marginal farmers.",
    "Predictive analytics for optimal crop cycle planning and potential market price forecasts."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system integrates data from multiple sources: satellite imagery for soil health and crop growth, local weather station APIs for real-time conditions, and farmer-input data. AI and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms process this data to generate personalized recommendations for crop selection, irrigation schedules, nutrient management, and timely pest/disease alerts. Technologies involved include: IoT sensors for collecting soil parameters (moisture, pH, nutrients); Satellite imagery and drone technology for remote sensing of crop health and land analysis; Weather APIs for hyper-local forecasts; Machine Learning models for predictive analytics, disease detection (via image recognition), and recommendation engines; AI for intelligent decision support and personalized advisory; a user-friendly Mobile Application as the interface for farmers to input data and receive advice, potentially with Natural Language Processing (NLP) for voice commands in local languages; and Cloud Computing for scalable data storage and processing.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Leverages readily available open-source ML frameworks and satellite data APIs.",
    "High mobile penetration in rural areas enables widespread adoption of the advisory app.",
    "Low-cost IoT sensors are increasingly accessible for soil and environmental monitoring.",
    "Existing government digital infrastructure can support data dissemination."

  "viability_points": [
    "Potential for subscription models or partnerships with agricultural input suppliers.",
    "Increased farmer income through better yields creates sustainable demand for the service.",
    "Government and NGO support for agri-tech initiatives provides funding opportunities."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Significant increase in crop yields and reduction in post-harvest losses.",
    "Empowers farmers with knowledge, leading to improved livelihoods and food security."
  ],
  "beneficiaries": [
    "Small and marginal farmers who gain access to vital, personalized agricultural knowledge.",
    "Agricultural input suppliers and government agencies benefit from aggregated data insights."
