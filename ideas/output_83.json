  "how_it_works": "The system employs seismic sensors (accelerometers) to detect ground motion. Upon detecting a seismic event, an integrated control unit (microcontroller/PLC) activates an active stabilization mechanism. This could involve hydraulic or pneumatic actuators working in conjunction with base isolation platforms (e.g., rolling-ball, sliding, or elastomeric bearings) to decouple the dialysis machine from ground vibrations. Passive dampening technologies like viscous dampers or tuned mass dampers could also be utilized. Real-time data from sensors could be processed using embedded systems or IoT platforms, potentially incorporating AI for predictive analysis of ground motion. The entire system is powered by a robust, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to ensure operation during power outages.",
