  "need_to_know": "A \"dialysis system\" is a medical treatment that removes waste products and excess fluid from the blood when kidneys fail. \"Seismic events\" are natural ground tremors or earthquakes.",
  "problem_statement": "Current dialysis systems are vulnerable to damage and disruption during earthquakes, endangering patients who rely on continuous treatment for survival. Patient safety during seismic events is a critical concern.",
  "idea": "Develop an \"Earthquake-Resilient Dialysis Unit\" (ERDU) that integrates advanced seismic stabilization technologies to ensure continuous and safe dialysis treatment for patients during and immediately after seismic events.",
  "problem_resolution": "The ERDU mitigates earthquake-induced risks by isolating dialysis machines from ground motion, preventing equipment damage, and maintaining critical connections. This ensures uninterrupted, life-sustaining treatment for vulnerable patients.",
  "usps": [
    "Guaranteed patient safety: Minimizes physical harm and treatment interruption for patients during earthquakes.",
    "Uninterrupted treatment: Ensures continuous dialysis operation, crucial for patient survival in critical situations.",
    "Reduced equipment damage: Protects expensive dialysis machines and infrastructure from seismic forces.",
    "Integrated monitoring: Real-time seismic activity and system stability monitoring for immediate alerts.",
    "Rapid post-event readiness: System allows quick assessment and resumption of services after a seismic event."

  "how_it_works": "The Earthquake-Resilient Dialysis Unit (ERDU) utilizes a multi-layered approach to stabilization. The core technology is base isolation, where the entire dialysis unit (machines, patient chairs, and connected infrastructure) rests on a flexible foundation that decouples it from ground motion. This can involve lead-rubber bearings, friction pendulum systems, or spring-damper mechanisms, absorbing seismic energy and reducing lateral forces. Integrated accelerometers and gyroscopes continuously monitor ground motion and system stability, triggering safety protocols. Self-sealing fluid connectors and reinforced tubing prevent leaks and disconnections of critical dialysis lines, using materials resistant to stress and vibration. Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) ensure continuous power even if the main grid fails, maintaining machine operation. Additionally, the unit incorporates a secure anchoring system for individual machines to the isolated platform, preventing tipping or movement within the unit. The entire system is housed in a robust, lightweight, and vibration-dampened casing for enhanced protection.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Leverages mature seismic isolation and dampening technologies used in buildings and bridges.",
    "Modular design permits integration of stabilization components into existing or new dialysis units.",
    "Advances in sensor technology and robust materials make real-time monitoring and secure connections viable."

  "viability_points": [
    "Significant market demand in earthquake-prone regions globally with large dialysis patient populations.",
    "Addresses a critical, life-threatening gap in emergency medical preparedness and patient care.",
    "Potential for strong support from healthcare institutions, disaster relief organizations, and insurance providers."
