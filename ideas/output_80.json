  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system leverages Machine Learning, specifically Reinforcement Learning and Predictive Analytics, alongside advanced Optimization Algorithms. It gathers real-time data from various sources: IoT sensors on trains (speed, location, power consumption), passenger ticketing systems (demand patterns), weather forecasts, and historical operational data (delays, maintenance logs). This data is fed into a central cloud-based platform where the AI model processes it to identify patterns, predict future demand, and generate optimal train induction and operational schedules. The optimization algorithms consider factors like energy efficiency, passenger capacity, maintenance windows, and potential disruptions. The generated schedules are then integrated with KMRL's existing operational control systems, allowing for real-time adjustments based on live conditions. The system continuously learns and refines its scheduling strategies over time, improving accuracy and efficiency.",
