  "need_to_know": "Water-Borne Diseases are illnesses caused by pathogenic microorganisms transmitted through contaminated water (e.g., cholera, typhoid). Rural Northeast India faces challenges like difficult terrain and limited infrastructure. Smart Community Health Monitoring uses IoT and data analytics for real-time health data collection and analysis.",
  "problem_statement": "Rural Northeast India faces prevalent water-borne diseases due to poor sanitation and lack of monitoring. There's a critical need for an effective system to detect and warn communities early, preventing outbreaks and improving public health outcomes.",
  "idea": "A community-led, IoT-enabled health monitoring and early warning system for water-borne diseases. It integrates real-time water quality sensors, localized health data collection, and AI analytics to predict and prevent outbreaks in rural Northeast India.",
  "problem_resolution": "This system provides real-time water quality and health data, enabling proactive alerts and interventions. It bridges infrastructure gaps, empowers local communities, and significantly reduces the incidence and impact of water-borne disease outbreaks.",
  "usps": [
    "Real-time, hyper-local water quality and health data for immediate action.",
    "Community-driven approach fosters local ownership and system sustainability.",
    "AI-powered predictive analytics for early disease outbreak warnings.",
    "Low-cost, robust IoT sensors designed for challenging rural environments.",
    "Integrated alert system via local communication channels like SMS and community radio."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "Low-cost, robust IoT sensors are deployed in community water sources (wells, rivers) to monitor parameters like pH, turbidity, and temperature. Data is transmitted wirelessly via LoRaWAN or cellular networks. Community Health Workers (CHWs) use mobile apps to collect localized health symptom data. All data streams into a central cloud platform. Machine learning algorithms analyze water quality, environmental factors (e.g., rainfall), and health symptom data to identify correlations and predict potential disease outbreaks. When thresholds are exceeded or an outbreak is predicted, automated alerts are sent to local health authorities, CHWs, and community members via SMS or voice messages. These alerts trigger immediate actions such as advising water boiling, distributing purification tablets, or mobilizing medical teams. Technologies involved include custom IoT sensors, LoRaWAN/NB-IoT connectivity, Android/iOS mobile applications, cloud computing (e.g., AWS, Azure) for data processing and storage, Machine Learning/AI for predictive analytics, and SMS/voice gateways for alerts.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Affordable IoT sensor technology and open-source platforms reduce deployment costs.",
    "Leverages existing community health worker networks for data collection and outreach.",
    "Scalable modular design allows phased implementation across diverse rural areas."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Reduces healthcare burden and economic loss from water-borne diseases, showing clear ROI.",
    "Potential for government and NGO funding due to strong public health and developmental impact.",
    "Empowers communities with actionable information, fostering long-term behavioral change."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Significantly reduces morbidity and mortality rates from water-borne diseases.",
    "Improves overall community health, productivity, and quality of life in rural areas."
  ],
  "beneficiaries": [
    "Rural communities in Northeast India gain access to safer water and better health outcomes.",
    "Local health authorities and NGOs can make data-driven decisions for public health."
