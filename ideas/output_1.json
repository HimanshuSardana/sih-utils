  "need_to_know": "Water-borne diseases spread via contaminated water, common in areas with poor sanitation. Rural Northeast India faces unique challenges due to terrain, limited infrastructure, and accessibility. A smart community system uses technology for local, real-time health data collection and alerts.",
  "problem_statement": "Rural Northeast India suffers from prevalent water-borne diseases due to inadequate infrastructure and delayed detection. There's a critical need for a localized, real-time monitoring and early warning system to safeguard community health.",
  "idea": "Develop an IoT-based Smart Community Health Monitoring and Early Warning System. It will use sensors for water quality, track disease symptoms, and leverage AI for predictive analysis to prevent water-borne disease outbreaks in rural Northeast India.",
  "problem_resolution": "This system provides real-time water quality data and health trends, enabling early detection and rapid response to potential outbreaks. It empowers local health workers and informs communities, significantly reducing disease incidence and improving public health outcomes.",
  "usps": [
    "Real-time, localized water quality monitoring using IoT sensors.",
    "AI-driven predictive analytics for early outbreak warnings.",
    "Community-led data collection via mobile apps for symptom tracking.",
    "Integrated communication system for rapid alerts to health officials.",
    "Sustainable, low-cost solution tailored for rural infrastructure."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "IoT sensors deployed in community water sources continuously monitor parameters like pH, turbidity, and pathogen indicators. Local health workers and trained community members use a mobile app to report symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, fever) anonymously. All data is sent to a central cloud platform. An AI/ML model analyzes water quality, symptom data, and historical patterns to identify potential outbreaks and predict risks. When thresholds are breached, the system automatically triggers early warnings via SMS, app notifications, and local digital displays to community members, health officials, and local authorities. Technologies involved include: IoT sensors (ESP32/Raspberry Pi based for data collection), Mobile Application (Android/iOS for symptom reporting and alerts), Cloud Platform (AWS/Azure/GCP for data storage and processing), AI/ML Models (Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch for predictive analytics), and Communication Protocols (LoRaWAN/GSM for data transmission, SMS/WhatsApp APIs for alerts).",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Affordable IoT sensors and mobile technology are readily available.",
    "Existing community health worker networks can facilitate data collection.",
    "Cloud computing platforms offer scalable, accessible infrastructure."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Reduces healthcare costs by preventing widespread outbreaks.",
    "Improves community productivity by reducing illness burden.",
    "Potential for government or NGO funding for public health initiatives."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Significantly reduces morbidity and mortality from water-borne diseases.",
    "Empowers communities with information, fostering proactive health management."
  ],
  "beneficiaries": [
    "Rural communities in Northeast India gain improved health and safety.",
    "Local health departments and NGOs enhance disease surveillance and response."
