  "need_to_know": "AR stands for Augmented Reality, which overlays digital information onto the real world via a device camera. Cultural Heritage Preservation involves protecting and presenting historical sites, artifacts, and traditions.",
  "problem_statement": "Traditional methods struggle with accessibility, engagement, and degradation of physical sites. Many historical contexts are lost or hard to visualize for the public, limiting widespread appreciation and understanding.",
  "idea": "Develop an Augmented Reality (AR) platform allowing users to virtually explore and interact with cultural heritage sites and artifacts, enhancing accessibility, engagement, and educational value.",
  "problem_resolution": "Our AR platform overcomes physical limitations and degradation, making cultural heritage accessible globally. It offers immersive, interactive experiences, bringing history to life for deeper understanding and engagement.",
  "usps": [
    "Immersive 3D reconstructions of historical sites and artifacts.",
    "Interactive storytelling at heritage locations through AR overlays.",
    "Global accessibility, bringing endangered or distant sites to users.",
    "Rich educational content integrated for all age groups and learners.",
    "Potential for crowdsourced contributions to cultural preservation."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The platform works by utilizing mobile Augmented Reality (AR) frameworks like ARCore and ARKit. First, 3D models of heritage sites and artifacts are created using photogrammetry and LiDAR scanning, combined with historical research. These models are then imported into game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine, where interactive elements (e.g., audio guides, informational hotspots, animated historical events) are added. The user downloads a mobile application. When they point their device camera at a physical heritage site or even a specific marker, the app uses computer vision and GPS data to recognize the location. It then overlays the pre-rendered 3D models and interactive content onto the real-world view in real-time, accurately aligned with the physical environment. Users can walk around, zoom in, and interact with the virtual content as if it were part of their surroundings. Cloud storage ensures content delivery and updates, while a content management system allows for easy addition of new heritage data.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "AR technology is mature and readily available on most modern smartphones.",
    "3D scanning, modeling tools, and historical data are accessible resources.",
    "Existing digital heritage archives can be integrated to build initial content quickly."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Strong market demand for immersive educational and cultural tourism experiences.",
    "Opportunities for partnerships with museums, institutions, and tourism boards.",
    "Potential for multiple revenue streams through subscriptions, premium content, and grants."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Democratizes access to cultural heritage, making it globally available to everyone.",
    "Digitally preserves at-risk historical sites and artifacts for future generations."
  ],
  "beneficiaries": [
    "Tourists and students seeking interactive, engaging learning experiences about history.",
    "Cultural institutions and historians for digital archiving and public outreach."
