  "need_to_know": "The 'PM Internship Scheme' refers to a program designed for students seeking internships in Product Management. An 'AI-Based Recommendation Engine' utilizes artificial intelligence to suggest suitable matches by analyzing data.",
  "problem_statement": "Students struggle to find relevant Product Management internships, and companies face challenges identifying suitable candidates. Manual matching is inefficient, leading to suboptimal placements and lost opportunities for both sides.",
  "idea": "An AI-powered recommendation engine specifically designed to intelligently match students with Product Management internships, considering skills, interests, and company requirements for optimal placements.",
  "problem_resolution": "This engine leverages AI to analyze student profiles and internship descriptions, providing highly personalized recommendations. It streamlines the matching process, ensuring better fit for students and efficient talent acquisition for companies.",
  "usps": [
    "Delivers highly personalized recommendations based on detailed student profiles and role requirements, enhancing fit.",
    "Significantly reduces manual screening and application processes for both students and recruiters.",
    "Improves internship satisfaction and retention rates by ensuring a better match between intern and company.",
    "Provides data-driven insights to program administrators for continuous improvement and talent pipeline analysis.",
    "Scalable solution capable of efficiently handling a large volume of applicants and diverse internship opportunities."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system employs Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Collaborative Filtering techniques. Student data, including resumes, skills, academic background, and preferences, is collected. Internship data, such as job descriptions, required skills, and company culture, is also ingested. NLP processes textual data to extract key features and understand nuances. ML models, like content-based filtering (matching student skills to job requirements) and collaborative filtering (recommending based on similar users/jobs), analyze these features. A ranking algorithm then generates personalized recommendations for students and suitable candidate lists for companies. Technologies involved would include Python for backend development, libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for ML model training, and potentially a web framework like React or Angular for the user interface.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Mature AI and ML technologies are readily available, making implementation technically feasible.",
    "Access to relevant data, like anonymized resumes and job descriptions, can facilitate model training.",
    "A minimum viable product (MVP) with core recommendation features can be built relatively quickly."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Addresses a clear market need for efficient, personalized internship matching in a competitive sector.",
    "Potential for diverse revenue streams, including premium features for companies or students.",
    "Scalable architecture allows for expansion to other internship categories or career development services."
