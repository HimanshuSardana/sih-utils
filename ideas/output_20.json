  "how_it_works": "The SmartVision TrackScan System integrates high-resolution cameras, LiDAR sensors, and advanced accelerometers mounted on a specialized rail car or existing trains. GPS data provides location context. Raw optical and 3D profile data are captured at high speeds. Onboard Edge AI processors, powered by NVIDIA Jetson or similar hardware, perform initial real-time anomaly detection, like rail cracks or worn sections, using pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This filtered data, along with critical alerts, is transmitted via an IoT cellular module (e.g., 5G/LTE) to a secure cloud platform (like AWS or Azure). Cloud-based deep learning models conduct further in-depth analysis for classification and severity assessment of defects. A centralized dashboard visualizes track health, generates maintenance work orders, and predicts future degradation using historical data analysis. The system uses technologies such as Computer Vision, Machine Learning (CNNs, Anomaly Detection), LiDAR/Laser Scanning, IoT for data transmission, and Cloud Computing for storage and advanced analytics.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Key sensor technologies like high-resolution cameras and LiDAR are mature and readily available.",
    "AI/ML frameworks and edge computing hardware can process data efficiently onboard.",
    "Existing railway infrastructure can host the system with minimal modification."
