  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system integrates multiple data sources from various sensors strategically placed within the mine, including LiDAR for precise topographical mapping and deformation detection, radar for monitoring surface movement, ground-penetrating radar for subsurface anomaly detection, seismic sensors for detecting micro-seismic activity indicating instability, and inclinometers for measuring slope deformation. Environmental data such as rainfall and temperature from weather stations are also incorporated. This continuous stream of raw data is processed and fed into a sophisticated machine learning model, potentially utilizing deep learning architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for time-series analysis of deformation or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for analyzing spatial data patterns. The AI model, trained on historical rockfall incidents, geological surveys, and real-time sensor data, learns to identify precursor patterns indicative of potential rockfall. When the model predicts a high probability of rockfall exceeding a predefined threshold, the system triggers immediate, multi-channel alerts (e.g., SMS, email, visual alarms, integrated control room dashboards) to mine managers, safety officers, and onsite personnel. Cloud computing infrastructure provides scalable data storage, processing power for AI models, and facilitates remote monitoring and system updates.",
