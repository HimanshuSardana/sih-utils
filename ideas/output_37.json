  "how_it_works": "The system involves a standard digital camera to capture high-resolution images of beach sand directly on site. These images are then processed using advanced computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms. Image processing identifies individual sand grains, segmenting them from the background, and accurately calculates their size, shape, and distribution. Technologies involved include image acquisition (using off-the-shelf digital cameras), image segmentation (e.g., using algorithms like Otsu's method or more advanced deep learning models), object detection and analysis (e.g., contour detection and measurement in OpenCV, or custom Convolutional Neural Networks trained on sand grain datasets), and statistical analysis to map grain sizes across an area. The processed data can then be visualized, integrated into Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and used to generate detailed grain size distribution maps.",
