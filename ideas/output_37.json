  "how_it_works": "The system uses a standard digital camera (e.g., smartphone, drone-mounted camera) to capture high-resolution images of beach sand. These images are then processed using computer vision algorithms. First, calibration is performed using a known scale object in the image. Next, image segmentation isolates individual sand grains. Machine learning models, trained on datasets of various sand grain sizes, analyze features like pixel area, perimeter, and shape eccentricity to determine the size distribution of grains within the image. Technologies involved include: Digital Cameras: For image acquisition. Computer Vision Libraries (e.g., OpenCV): For image preprocessing, segmentation, and feature extraction. Machine Learning Frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch): To build and deploy models for grain size classification. Geospatial Information Systems (GIS): To map the analyzed grain size data geographically, creating comprehensive maps. Cloud Computing (optional): For large-scale image processing and data storage.",
