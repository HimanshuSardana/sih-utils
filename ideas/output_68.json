  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system involves DWLR devices deployed in borewells, continuously measuring water levels. These devices transmit data via IoT communication modules (e.g., LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, cellular) to a central cloud platform. The cloud platform uses databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store time-series data. Data processing involves real-time analytics engines (e.g., Apache Kafka for streaming, Python with libraries like Pandas/NumPy for analysis) to clean, validate, and derive insights (e.g., recharge rates, depletion trends). Machine learning models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) can be employed for predictive forecasting. A user-friendly web dashboard (built with frameworks like React/Angular/Vue.js and a backend API in Python/Node.js/Java) visualizes the data, trends, and predictions through interactive maps and charts. Alerts are triggered via SMS/email for critical level changes. Geospatial information systems (GIS) are integrated to map water resource distribution.",
  "feasibility_points": [
