  "need_to_know": "Sikkim is an Indian state known for its unique culture and numerous Buddhist monasteries. 'Digitize' means creating digital versions using technology like 3D scans and virtual reality. 'Showcase' implies making these accessible globally to promote tourism and ensure cultural preservation.",
  "problem_statement": "Sikkim's ancient monasteries, rich in cultural heritage, face limited global visibility and preservation challenges. Digitizing and showcasing them can enhance tourism, attract broader audiences, and safeguard their invaluable cultural significance for future generations.",
  "idea": "Develop an immersive digital platform featuring Sikkim's monasteries using VR/AR. This platform will offer virtual tours, educational content, and interactive experiences to promote tourism and ensure the long-term preservation of cultural heritage.",
  "problem_resolution": "The digital platform resolves limited visibility by offering global access to monasteries via VR/AR. It ensures cultural preservation through digital archiving and educates visitors, making heritage accessible and sustainable for future generations.",
  "usps": [
    "Immersive VR tours provide global access to detailed monastery interiors and serene spiritual experiences.",
    "AR guides enhance on-site visits with real-time historical facts, legends, and cultural context.",
    "A centralized digital archive permanently preserves intricate artworks, manuscripts, and architectural details.",
    "Interactive learning modules educate users on Buddhist philosophy, traditions, and local customs.",
    "Promotes sustainable tourism by reducing physical impact while increasing cultural appreciation and local economy support."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The idea involves developing a multi-platform application (web and mobile) to host digital content. We'll utilize 3D scanning and photogrammetry technologies (e.g., RealityCapture, Metashape) to create high-fidelity 3D models and virtual reality environments of monasteries. Virtual tours will be built using game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine, compatible with VR headsets and web browsers. Augmented reality features for on-site experiences will be developed using ARCore (Android) and ARKit (iOS), allowing users to overlay digital information (history, stories, 3D artifacts) onto their physical surroundings through their smartphone cameras. The backend will be powered by cloud services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) for scalable storage of high-resolution images, videos, 3D assets, and textual data. A content management system (CMS) will enable easy updates and additions of new monasteries and information. AI will be used for content tagging, search optimization, and personalized user recommendations, enhancing discoverability and engagement. GPS integration will be crucial for location-aware AR experiences.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Modern 3D scanning and VR/AR development tools are readily available and mature enough.",
    "Cloud infrastructure provides scalable storage and processing for extensive digital content.",
    "A growing talent pool in photogrammetry, 3D modeling, and XR development exists.",
    "Government initiatives and funding support cultural digitization and tourism projects."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Potential for diverse revenue streams through premium VR tours, partnerships, and sponsorships.",
    "High global demand for unique cultural and immersive travel experiences online.",
    "Strong support from cultural organizations and local governments for heritage preservation.",
    "Scalable platform design allows for future expansion to other cultural sites or regions."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Significantly boosts tourism to Sikkim, creating new economic opportunities for local communities.",
    "Ensures the invaluable cultural and architectural heritage of monasteries is preserved digitally forever."
  ],
  "beneficiaries": [
    "Global tourists and cultural enthusiasts gain unprecedented, immersive access to Sikkim's spiritual sites.",
    "Local communities and monastic institutions benefit from increased visibility, tourism revenue, and heritage preservation support."
