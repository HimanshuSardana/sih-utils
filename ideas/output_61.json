  "need_to_know": "Sikkim is an Indian state known for its unique culture and numerous Buddhist monasteries. Digitizing means creating digital replicas/information, and showcasing involves making them accessible to a wider audience.",
  "problem_statement": "Sikkim's monasteries face challenges in global visibility for tourism and require modern methods for cultural preservation. Their rich history and art are not fully accessible to a wider audience.",
  "idea": "Develop an immersive digital platform featuring 3D virtual tours, AR/VR experiences, and a comprehensive cultural archive of Sikkim's monasteries. This enhances global accessibility for tourism and ensures preservation.",
  "problem_resolution": "The platform solves low visibility by offering global access to monastery experiences. It aids preservation by digitally archiving cultural assets, ensuring their longevity and educational reach beyond physical limits.",
  "usps": [
    "Interactive 3D virtual tours provide an immersive experience, allowing users to explore monasteries remotely, boosting accessibility.",
    "Integrated AR/VR modules offer unique, deeper engagement, bringing ancient rituals and art to life for a global audience.",
    "Comprehensive digital archives preserve rare manuscripts, artifacts, and oral histories, safeguarding cultural heritage for future generations.",

  "how_it_works": "The platform utilizes 3D scanning and photogrammetry for creating detailed digital twins of monasteries. Users can navigate these environments via a web application or mobile app. Augmented Reality (AR) features, developed with ARKit/ARCore, overlay digital information onto physical spaces through smartphone cameras, offering interactive guides. Virtual Reality (VR) experiences, built using Unity or Unreal Engine with VR headsets (e.g., Oculus, HTC Vive), transport users into fully immersive monastery environments. A robust Content Management System (CMS) handles the archiving of cultural data, including high-resolution images, videos, audio recordings, and text descriptions of artifacts and rituals. Backend services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) manage data storage and streaming, ensuring high availability and scalability. Frontend development uses modern web frameworks like React or Vue.js for an intuitive user interface. AI/ML can be integrated for content recommendation and natural language processing for search functionality.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Existing 3D scanning and photogrammetry technologies are mature and accessible, allowing efficient digital asset creation.",
    "Open-source development frameworks and cloud infrastructure reduce initial development costs and accelerate deployment.",
    "Local partnerships with monastery administrations can facilitate data collection and ensure cultural authenticity."
