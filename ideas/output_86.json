  "need_to_know": "NEP 2020 (National Education Policy 2020) emphasizes flexible, multidisciplinary education. Multidisciplinary education structures allow students to choose diverse subjects across different fields, requiring complex timetable management.",
  "problem_statement": "Generating efficient, compliant timetables for educational institutions under NEP 2020's multidisciplinary framework is highly complex. Manual methods are time-consuming and prone to errors.",
  "idea": "Develop an AI-powered timetable generation system that seamlessly aligns with NEP 2020 principles, accommodating multidisciplinary course selections, faculty availability, and resource optimization.",
  "problem_resolution": "This AI system automates and optimizes timetable creation, efficiently managing complex constraints of multidisciplinary courses and NEP 2020. It reduces manual effort and minimizes conflicts.",
  "usps": [
    "NEP 2020 Compliance: Automatically adheres to policy guidelines for flexible and holistic education.",
    "AI Optimization: Utilizes advanced algorithms to find the most efficient and conflict-free schedules.",
    "Multidisciplinary Flexibility: Seamlessly integrates diverse subject choices and cross-faculty courses.",
    "Resource Management: Optimizes allocation of classrooms, labs, and faculty time effectively.",
    "User-Friendly Interface: Provides intuitive tools for administrators to manage and customize timetables."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system leverages Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms to process various inputs: student course selections, faculty expertise and availability, classroom/lab capacities, and NEP 2020 guidelines. It uses constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) solvers and optimization techniques to generate multiple feasible timetable options. A user-friendly interface allows administrators to input data, set priorities, and review generated schedules. Technologies involved include Python for AI/ML development (e.g., TensorFlow, scikit-learn), cloud platforms (AWS, Azure) for scalability, and possibly a web framework (e.g., Django, React) for the front-end. Data is stored in databases (SQL/NoSQL) and APIs facilitate integration with existing SIS (Student Information Systems).",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Existing AI algorithms for scheduling and optimization are mature and readily available.",
    "Data for student preferences, faculty loads, and room availability can be digitally collected.",
    "Modular architecture allows for phased development and integration with current systems."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Growing demand for automated solutions to manage NEP 2020 complexities in education.",
    "Significant cost savings and efficiency gains for institutions by reducing manual workload.",
    "Scalable to various institution sizes, from small colleges to large universities."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Enhances educational quality by enabling flexible learning paths and reducing scheduling conflicts.",
    "Reduces administrative burden, freeing up staff to focus on more strategic tasks."
