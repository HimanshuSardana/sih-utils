  "need_to_know": "NEP 2020 (National Education Policy 2020) emphasizes holistic, flexible, and multidisciplinary education. Multidisciplinary Education Structures allow students to combine subjects from diverse fields, moving beyond traditional academic silos.",
  "problem_statement": "Current timetable generation systems struggle to accommodate NEP 2020's multidisciplinary education framework. This leads to complex scheduling, resource conflicts, and limited flexibility for student course choices across various disciplines.",
  "idea": "An AI-powered system that automates and optimizes timetable generation for educational institutions adopting NEP 2020. It ensures seamless integration of multidisciplinary courses while optimizing resource allocation and student choices.",
  "problem_resolution": "This AI system streamlines complex scheduling, resolves resource conflicts, and offers personalized, flexible timetables. It fully aligns with NEP 2020's multidisciplinary vision, enhancing both student experience and institutional efficiency.",
  "usps": [
    "Dynamically adapts to NEP 2020 curriculum changes and evolving student preferences.",
    "Optimizes utilization of faculty, classrooms, and other institutional resources effectively.",
    "Enables personalized learning paths for students with flexible, multidisciplinary course options.",
    "Significantly reduces manual scheduling errors and administrative time for institutions.",
    "Supports complex credit systems and inter-departmental course offerings effortlessly."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system takes inputs like student preferences, course availability, faculty expertise, classroom capacities, and NEP 2020 guidelines. An AI engine, utilizing machine learning algorithms such as genetic algorithms, constraint satisfaction problems, and neural networks for predictive analysis, processes these inputs. It optimizes schedules by prioritizing student choices, minimizing conflicts, balancing faculty workload, and ensuring multidisciplinary course availability. The output is a set of flexible, conflict-free timetables accessible via a user-friendly web/mobile interface. Technologies involved include Python for AI/ML development, Django/Node.js for the backend, React/Angular for the frontend, PostgreSQL for database management, and cloud platforms like AWS or Azure for scalable deployment.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Leverages readily available open-source AI/ML libraries, reducing development complexity and cost.",
    "Existing university data on courses, faculty, and student enrollment can effectively train the AI.",
    "Scalable cloud infrastructure ensures the system can handle varying institutional sizes and data loads.",
    "Integration with existing LMS/SIS platforms is achievable via standard APIs."
