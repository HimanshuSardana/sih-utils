  "how_it_works": "The platform leverages satellite imagery, drone footage, and street-level data. Computer Vision and Machine Learning algorithms identify road segments, lane markings, traffic signs, and intersections. A Deep Learning model processes historical traffic data and local driving patterns to infer behavioral parameters specific to India. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) integrate these layers, creating a comprehensive, high-fidelity digital twin of the road network. This model is then exported in formats compatible with standard traffic simulation software. Key technologies include OpenCV for image processing, TensorFlow/PyTorch for deep learning, and open-source GIS libraries like GDAL/Shapely for spatial data handling and integration.",
