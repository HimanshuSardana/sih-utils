  "how_it_works": "Tourists register for a Blockchain-based Digital ID, which securely stores essential information without centralizing personal data. Their location is continuously monitored via a mobile application or wearable device. AI algorithms analyze movement patterns, behavior, and location data to detect anomalies or deviations from safe routes. Geo-fencing sets virtual boundaries around safe zones, attractions, or restricted areas; if a tourist crosses these, an alert is triggered. In case of an emergency (e.g., a tourist entering a high-risk zone, a distress signal), the AI system processes the data, and the digital ID facilitates immediate identification. Local authorities and emergency services receive instant alerts with location data and encrypted digital ID for rapid, targeted response. Technologies involved include: Blockchain for immutable digital identities; Artificial Intelligence (AI) for anomaly detection and predictive analytics; Geo-Fencing using GPS and location-based services for virtual perimeters; Mobile Application/Wearable Technology for user interface and data collection; Cloud Computing for scalable data processing; and API Integrations for connecting with emergency services.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Existing GPS, AI, and blockchain technologies are mature enough for integration and deployment.",
    "Smartphones and wearables provide the necessary hardware for location tracking and user interaction.",
    "Open-source blockchain platforms and cloud services reduce development and infrastructure costs.",
    "Interoperability standards allow integration with existing emergency response systems."
