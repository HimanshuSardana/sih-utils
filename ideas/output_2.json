  "need_to_know": "AI (Artificial Intelligence) is used for data analysis and pattern recognition. Geo-Fencing creates virtual boundaries, triggering alerts when crossed. Blockchain-based Digital ID provides a secure, tamper-proof digital identity for tourists, ensuring privacy and verifiable authentication.",
  "problem_statement": "Tourists often face safety risks in unfamiliar locations, including getting lost, theft, or medical emergencies. Current incident response systems can be slow, lack real-time data, and struggle with secure identification, leading to delayed or inefficient aid.",
  "idea": "A Smart Tourist Safety Monitoring & Incident Response System leveraging AI for real-time threat detection, geo-fencing for restricted zone alerts, and blockchain-based digital IDs for secure, rapid identification and enhanced emergency response capabilities.",
  "problem_resolution": "The system proactively monitors tourist safety, providing instant alerts for potential dangers or geo-fencing breaches. Blockchain IDs ensure swift, secure identification, enabling authorities to respond faster and more effectively, ultimately enhancing tourist well-being.",
  "usps": [
    "Proactive AI-powered threat detection and anomaly identification for enhanced safety.",
    "Secure, tamper-proof blockchain-based digital identity for robust data privacy.",
    "Real-time geo-fencing alerts for entry into restricted or unsafe areas.",
    "Significantly faster and more accurate incident response and resolution.",
    "Decentralized identification system reduces single points of failure and enhances trust."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system integrates several technologies. AI algorithms analyze data from registered tourist devices (e.g., smartphones, wearables) and public sensors to detect unusual behavior, distress signals, or environmental anomalies. Geo-fencing defines safe zones, restricted areas, or points of interest; if a tourist enters or exits these virtual boundaries, real-time alerts are sent to both the tourist and a central monitoring hub. A Blockchain-based Digital ID allows tourists to securely store encrypted personal, medical, and emergency contact information on a decentralized ledger. This ID is accessible by authorized emergency personnel only with explicit consent or in critical situations, ensuring data integrity and rapid identification without compromising privacy. In an incident, the system triangulates location, uses AI to assess the situation, triggers relevant geo-fencing alerts, and provides authenticated digital ID details to first responders for efficient, targeted assistance. Communication channels ensure seamless data flow between all components.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Core technologies (AI, GPS, blockchain) are mature and widely available for integration.",
    "High smartphone penetration among tourists supports app-based system deployment.",
    "Existing public safety infrastructure can be augmented with system data feeds."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Strong global demand for enhanced tourist safety and peace of mind services.",
    "Potential for partnerships with tourism boards, hotels, and travel agencies.",
    "Subscription models for tourists or government funding can ensure sustainability."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Significantly reduces tourist-related incidents, enhancing overall safety and confidence.",
    "Boosts tourism sector reputation by demonstrating commitment to visitor welfare."
  ],
  "beneficiaries": [
    "Tourists gain enhanced personal safety, peace of mind, and rapid emergency assistance.",
    "Local authorities and tourism operators achieve better incident management and public image."
