  "need_to_know": "Waste Management involves collecting, transporting, processing, recycling, or disposing of waste materials. It's crucial for public health, environmental protection, and resource recovery.",
  "problem_statement": "Inefficient waste collection, improper segregation, and overflowing landfills pose significant environmental and public health challenges globally, requiring innovative, scalable solutions for effective management.",
  "idea": "A 'Smart Circular Waste Hub' \u2013 a community-based, tech-enabled platform optimizing waste collection, segregation, and upcycling, promoting a circular economy and reducing landfill burden.",
  "problem_resolution": "This hub addresses inefficient waste management by using smart bins for optimal collection routes, incentivizing segregation, and connecting waste to recycling/upcycling initiatives, reducing landfill waste.",
  "usps": [
    "Real-time waste level monitoring for optimized collection routes, reducing fuel costs and emissions.",
    "AI-powered segregation assistance guiding users to correctly sort waste for higher recycling rates.",
    "Blockchain-based incentive system rewarding communities and individuals for proper waste disposal.",
    "Integrated marketplace connecting segregated waste directly to upcycling businesses and recyclers.",
    "Hyperlocal impact data and analytics for city planners to make informed waste management decisions."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The Smart Circular Waste Hub utilizes IoT-enabled smart bins with ultrasonic sensors to monitor fill levels and detect waste types. This data feeds into a central cloud platform (e.g., AWS IoT) that optimizes collection routes using AI algorithms (e.g., machine learning for route optimization). A mobile application allows users to report waste, receive segregation guidelines via computer vision (e.g., TensorFlow Lite on device), and earn points through a blockchain-based reward system (e.g., Ethereum smart contracts for token issuance). The platform also features a marketplace connecting verified waste streams (plastics, organics, e-waste) to local upcyclers, recyclers, and compost facilities. Technologies involved include IoT, AI/ML, cloud computing, mobile app development, and blockchain.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Leverages existing IoT infrastructure and cloud platforms for rapid deployment.",
    "Mobile app development is standard; AI/ML for sorting and routing is well-established.",
    "Modular design allows for phased implementation and scalability in different communities."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Reduces waste disposal costs for municipalities, creating direct savings.",
    "Generates revenue by selling high-quality segregated raw materials to recyclers and upcyclers.",
    "Creates green jobs in waste collection, processing, and community engagement roles."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Significantly reduces landfill waste and environmental pollution, improving public health.",
    "Promotes a circular economy by maximizing resource recovery and minimizing virgin material use."
  ],
  "beneficiaries": [
    "Local municipalities and waste management companies benefit from optimized operations and reduced costs.",
    "Community residents benefit from cleaner environments, health improvements, and economic incentives."
