  "need_to_know": "Waste Management refers to the processes and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal. This includes collection, transport, treatment, recycling, and disposal of waste materials.",
  "problem_statement": "Inefficient waste collection, poor segregation, and lack of community engagement lead to environmental pollution and health hazards. Current systems struggle with volume and proper disposal, demanding innovative solutions for sustainable living.",
  "idea": "A smart, integrated community-based waste management system utilizing IoT sensors and AI-driven logistics to optimize segregation, collection, and recycling processes for urban areas.",
  "problem_resolution": "This system addresses poor segregation with smart bins, optimizes collection routes via AI, and encourages community participation through gamification, significantly reducing landfill waste and increasing recycling rates.",
  "usps": [
    "AI-optimized collection routes reduce fuel consumption and operational costs.",
    "IoT-enabled smart bins notify collection services when full, preventing overflow.",
    "Gamified rewards incentivize citizens for proper waste segregation.",
    "Real-time data analytics provide insights for policy making and waste reduction strategies.",
    "Modular design allows for scalable deployment in diverse urban environments."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system integrates several technologies. IoT sensors embedded in smart bins detect fill levels and types of waste (e.g., organic, dry, recyclable). This data is transmitted to a central cloud platform. AI algorithms analyze this data to optimize collection routes for trucks, ensuring efficient pick-ups only when bins are near full, thus reducing fuel consumption and operational costs. A mobile application allows citizens to log their segregated waste, earn points for correct sorting, and redeem rewards. Blockchain technology could be integrated for transparent tracking of waste from generation to recycling/disposal, ensuring accountability. Big data analytics are used to identify waste generation patterns and inform waste reduction campaigns.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Existing IoT and AI technologies are mature and affordable for deployment.",
    "Scalable cloud infrastructure supports data processing and application hosting.",
    "Pilot programs can validate effectiveness and gather user feedback before wider rollout."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Reduced operational costs for municipalities through optimized logistics.",
    "Potential for revenue generation from high-quality segregated recyclable materials.",
    "Public-private partnerships can fund infrastructure and operational maintenance."
  ],
  "impact_points": [
    "Significant reduction in landfill waste and environmental pollution.",
    "Improved public health and sanitation in communities."
  ],
  "beneficiaries": [
    "Local municipalities benefit from efficient operations and cleaner cities.",
    "Citizens enjoy healthier living environments and participate in a greener future."
