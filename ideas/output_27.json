  "need_to_know": "Ayurvedic herbs are traditional Indian medicinal plants. Botanical traceability refers to tracking a plant's origin and journey through the supply chain. Geo-tagging involves adding geographical coordinates to data. Blockchain is a secure, decentralized, and immutable digital ledger.",
  "problem_statement": "Ensuring authenticity and transparent traceability of Ayurvedic herbs from collection to final product is a major challenge. Current systems lack verifiable proof of origin, purity, and supply chain integrity, leading to potential adulteration.",
  "idea": "A decentralized blockchain platform for end-to-end botanical traceability of Ayurvedic herbs. It will use geo-tagging and IoT for transparent tracking from collection by farmers/wild collectors to the final formulation label, ensuring authenticity.",
  "problem_resolution": "Our blockchain system provides an immutable record of each herb's journey, from geo-tagged collection to formulation. This ensures authenticity, prevents adulteration, builds consumer trust, and offers verifiable proof of origin and processing.",
  "usps": [
    "Immutable record of origin and processing via blockchain ensures data integrity and trust.",
    "Real-time geo-tagging for precise location data at every stage of the supply chain.",
    "Enhanced consumer trust through verifiable product authenticity and transparent sourcing.",
    "Significant reduction in adulteration and fraud within the Ayurvedic supply chain.",
    "Streamlined compliance and regulatory reporting for producers and manufacturers."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The system begins at the point of collection where farmers or wild collectors use a mobile application to geo-tag the precise location, capture photos of the herbs, and input initial data such as species and quantity. This information is time-stamped and immutably recorded onto a blockchain. As the herbs move through the supply chain (e.g., drying, processing, transportation), each handler scans a unique QR code or NFC tag associated with the batch. GPS data from their devices automatically updates location. Any processing steps, quality checks, or certifications are added as new blocks of data to the herb's immutable ledger. When an Ayurvedic manufacturer uses these herbs in a formulation, they record the specific batch IDs, linking the final product to the complete history of its ingredients. The final Ayurvedic product label will include a QR code, allowing consumers to scan it and access a comprehensive, verifiable history of the herbs, including their origin, processing details, and quality certifications. The core technologies involved are: Blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric or Ethereum for enterprise solutions) for secure, decentralized, and immutable data storage; GPS and Geo-tagging for location verification; IoT devices (optional, but can enhance data collection for environmental conditions); Mobile Applications for data input at collection and processing points; Smart Contracts to automate verification, trigger alerts, and manage ownership transfers; and QR/NFC Tags for easy physical tracking and data access.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Blockchain technology is mature and proven for supply chain traceability.",
    "Ubiquitous GPS and mobile technology enable widespread, easy geo-tagging.",
    "Existing supply chain logistics can integrate digital tracking solutions readily."
  ],
  "viability_points": [
    "Growing consumer demand for authentic, transparent, and ethically sourced Ayurvedic products.",
    "Reduces potential recall costs and significantly improves brand reputation for manufacturers.",
    "Enables premium pricing for certified, transparent products, creating new market opportunities."

  "impact_points": [
    "Empowers consumers with full transparency, ensuring product safety and quality.",
    "Supports ethical sourcing, fair trade practices, and sustainable collection for farmers."

  "beneficiaries": [
    "Consumers gain trust in the authenticity, purity, and safety of Ayurvedic medicines.",
    "Ayurvedic manufacturers enhance brand reputation, ensure compliance, and optimize supply chain efficiency."
