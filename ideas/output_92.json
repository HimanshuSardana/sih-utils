  ],
  "how_it_works": "The autonomous machine utilizes GPS/RTK for centimeter-level navigation accuracy within fields. Integrated computer vision systems, powered by deep learning models, analyze camera feeds to precisely differentiate between crops and weeds. Based on this identification, a precision robotic arm with specialized end-effectors (e.g., seed dispensers, micro-sprayers for targeted herbicide, or mechanical removers) performs the task. IoT sensors gather real-time data on soil conditions. All data is processed on-board or transmitted to a cloud platform for continuous learning, operational optimization, and detailed farm mapping. Key technologies include AI/Machine Learning, Computer Vision, GPS/RTK, Robotics (actuators, end-effectors), IoT sensors, and Cloud Computing.",
