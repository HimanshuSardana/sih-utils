  "need_to_know": "Roof Top Rainwater Harvesting (RTRWH) involves collecting and storing rainwater from rooftops for future use. Artificial Recharge (AR) is the process of intentionally replenishing groundwater aquifers through methods like percolation tanks or injection wells.",
  "problem_statement": "Assessing the potential for Roof Top Rainwater Harvesting and Artificial Recharge, along with sizing these systems, is currently complex and time-consuming. A need exists for an application to automate and simplify this on-spot evaluation process.",
  "idea": "Develop a user-friendly mobile and web application that provides on-spot assessment of Roof Top Rainwater Harvesting and Artificial Recharge potential. It will accurately size systems, offering data-driven insights for efficient water management.",
  "problem_resolution": "This application streamlines the assessment of RTRWH and AR potential, replacing manual calculations with an automated, location-specific analysis. It simplifies system sizing, enabling quick and accurate decisions for sustainable water management.",
  "usps": [
    "Automated, on-spot assessment provides immediate and accurate calculations for RTRWH and AR potential, saving significant time and effort.",
    "Leverages real-time weather data and geographical information for highly precise sizing and recommendations tailored to specific locations.",
    "Offers a user-friendly interface, making complex hydrological calculations accessible to homeowners, builders, and urban planners alike.",
    "Generates actionable recommendations and visual reports, empowering users to make informed decisions about water conservation projects.",
    "Promotes sustainable water management by simplifying the implementation of rainwater harvesting and artificial recharge systems globally."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The application will function by allowing users to input their location and roof dimensions (either manually or by selecting on a map). It will then use a combination of technologies: Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for spatial data and elevation, satellite imagery for roof area estimation (e.g., Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap data), and weather APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, national meteorological services) for historical and real-time rainfall data. Hydrological models and algorithms, incorporating roof material runoff coefficients and local rainfall patterns, will calculate the estimated rainwater yield. For artificial recharge, it will consider soil permeability data (from public databases or user input) and local geology to estimate recharge potential. The application will then output the optimal size for RTRWH tanks/ponds and AR structures, along with potential savings and benefits. The backend would handle data processing and storage (e.g., Python with Django/Flask, Node.js with Express, using PostgreSQL or MongoDB), while the frontend could be built with frameworks like React Native or Flutter for mobile, and React/Angular/Vue for web, ensuring a responsive and intuitive user experience.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Existing GIS, mapping, and weather APIs are mature and readily available for integration into the application.",
    "Standard hydrological models and algorithms can be adapted and implemented to accurately calculate runoff and recharge potential.",
    "Modern mobile and web development frameworks allow for efficient creation of robust and user-friendly interfaces.",
    "Cloud computing platforms offer scalable infrastructure for data processing and storage at a reasonable cost."
