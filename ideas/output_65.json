    "Instant, accurate on-spot assessment for RTRWH and AR potential.",
    "Automated calculation of system size and preliminary design recommendations.",
    "User-friendly interface requiring minimal technical expertise from users.",
    "Provides data-driven insights for optimal water conservation strategies.",
    "Significantly reduces the time and cost associated with manual site evaluations."
  ],
  "how_it_works": "The application leverages GPS to identify the user's location, automatically fetching local rainfall data and topographical information through integration with meteorological and GIS APIs. Users then input site-specific details such as roof area, material, and soil type. An internal algorithm, based on established hydrological principles and local regulations, processes this data to accurately calculate the rainwater harvesting potential and the optimal size for storage tanks or recharge pits. The system will utilize cloud computing for data storage, complex calculations, and delivering personalized recommendations. Potential future integrations include AI/ML for predictive analysis on water availability and CAD tools for generating basic design blueprints.",
  "feasibility_points": [
    "Existing geospatial data and meteorological APIs provide necessary input sources.",
    "Standard hydrological formulas are well-established for reliable calculation logic.",
    "Mobile development frameworks allow for rapid application prototyping and deployment."
