= To explore new/altermative assaying methods to the fire assay method for testing of gold jewellery and artefacts through non-destructive testing (Hardware)

== Need to Know
Fire assay is a traditional, destructive method for gold purity testing, requiring melting a sample. Non-destructive testing (NDT) refers to methods that analyze materials without causing any damage, preserving the item's integrity.

== Description
The gold industry needs alternative, non-destructive assaying methods for testing gold jewelry and artifacts. Current fire assay is accurate but destructive, causing irrecoverable damage to valuable items.

== Idea
To develop a portable, accurate, and non-destructive gold assaying system utilizing advanced spectroscopic technologies. This system will safely determine the purity of gold jewelry and historical artifacts without causing any damage.

== Problem Resolution
This innovative system provides rapid, precise gold purity assessment, eliminating the need for destructive fire assay. It preserves the integrity and value of precious gold items, benefiting jewelers and heritage institutions alike.

== How It Works
The idea proposes a hybrid non-destructive assaying system primarily utilizing X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) and Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) technologies. XRF works by irradiating the gold item with X-rays; the gold atoms then emit characteristic secondary X-rays whose energy and intensity are unique to gold and its alloys, allowing for precise quantification of elemental composition near the surface. LIBS, on the other hand, uses a pulsed laser to ablate a minuscule amount of material from the sample, creating a plasma. The light emitted from this plasma is then analyzed by a spectrometer. Each element in the gold alloy produces a unique spectral 'fingerprint,' enabling deeper and more localized elemental analysis. The combination of XRF for surface-level composition and LIBS for slightly deeper analysis provides a comprehensive and accurate purity assessment. Both technologies are integrated into a single, user-friendly device, with software processing the spectral data to calculate the gold fineness and display results instantly.

= Smart Waste Segregation and Recycling System (Hardware)

== Need to Know
Smart Waste Segregation refers to the automated or intelligent separation of different types of waste materials (e.g., plastics, paper, organic). A Recycling System is the process of converting waste materials into new products, aiming to reduce consumption of fresh raw materials.

== Description
Inefficient manual waste segregation leads to high contamination rates, hindering effective recycling processes. This results in increased landfill waste, environmental pollution, and the unnecessary depletion of natural resources.

== Idea
An AI-powered Smart Waste Segregation and Recycling System that automates waste sorting at the source, optimizes collection logistics, and improves overall recycling efficiency for a sustainable future.

== Problem Resolution
Our system leverages AI and IoT to accurately sort waste, reducing contamination and increasing recycling rates. It streamlines collection, minimizing operational costs and environmental impact, fostering a cleaner planet.

== How It Works
The system utilizes an intelligent waste bin equipped with IoT sensors (e.g., proximity, weight, chemical sensors) and an integrated camera. When waste is deposited, a computer vision model, trained with deep learning on various waste types, identifies the material. Robotic arms or mechanical sorting mechanisms then segregate the waste into designated compartments for different categories (e.g., plastics, paper, metal, organic). The data collected from these smart bins is sent to a cloud platform, where machine learning algorithms analyze fill levels and optimize collection routes for waste management vehicles. This entire process ensures accurate segregation at the point of disposal and efficient collection for recycling facilities. Technologies involved include IoT, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Robotics, Cloud Computing, and Data Analytics.

== Unique Selling Points
- High-accuracy AI-driven sorting at source reduces contamination significantly.
- Real-time data analytics provide insights for optimized waste collection routes and management.
- User-friendly interface encourages public participation and sustainable practices.
- Scalable and adaptable design suitable for diverse urban and residential environments.

= Automated High-Current Short-Circuit Test System for MCB to comply with IEC 60898-1:2015 (Hardware)

== Need to Know
MCB stands for Miniature Circuit Breaker, an automatic electrical switch protecting circuits from overload or short circuits. IEC 60898-1:2015 is an international standard defining performance requirements for MCBs used in households.

== Description
The existing process for high-current short-circuit testing of MCBs to comply with IEC 60898-1:2015 is often manual, time-consuming, and presents safety risks. This bottleneck impacts certification and production efficiency.

== Idea
Develop an automated, high-current short-circuit test system for Miniature Circuit Breakers (MCBs). This system will efficiently and safely verify MCB compliance with the stringent requirements of the IEC 60898-1:2015 standard.

== Problem Resolution
The automated system eliminates manual testing, drastically improving safety for operators. It accelerates test cycles, ensures consistent compliance, and provides precise data, thereby streamlining the certification process for MCB manufacturers.

== How It Works
The automated system integrates a high-current source, a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), various sensors, and custom software. An MCB is automatically loaded into a test fixture. The PLC, guided by the control software, activates the high-current source to apply a precise short-circuit current as per IEC 60898-1:2015. Sensors (current, voltage, temperature, trip status) continuously monitor the MCB's performance and environment. The data acquisition system captures all parameters in real-time. The control software analyzes the collected data against standard requirements to determine compliance. Safety interlocks controlled by the PLC ensure operator protection. Technologies involved include high-power switching components, precision current and voltage transducers, industrial PLCs (e.g., Siemens, Allen-Bradley), human-machine interfaces (HMI) for control, and a data logging and reporting module potentially developed using Python or LabVIEW. Robotic elements could handle MCB loading and unloading for full automation. The system validates the MCB's ability to safely interrupt high fault currents and withstand subsequent thermal and mechanical stresses.

== Unique Selling Points
- Enhanced operator safety by removing manual intervention during high-current short-circuit tests, minimizing hazard exposure.
